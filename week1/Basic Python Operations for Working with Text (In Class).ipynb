    "\n",
    "```Python\n",

       "'  IT WAS  best of times, it was  worst of times, it was \\nage of wisdom, it was  age of foolishness, it was  epoch of\\nbelief, it was  epoch of incredulity, it was  season of Light,\\nit was  season of Darkness, it was  spring of hope, it was \\nwinter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing\\nbefore us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going\\ndirect  other way- in short,  period was so far like  present\\nperiod, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being\\nreceived, for good or for evil, in  superlative degree of\\ncomparison only.\\n  There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on\\n throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a\\nqueen with a fair face, on  throne of France. In both countries\\nit was clearer than crystal to  lords of  State preserves of\\nloaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.\\n  It was  year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and\\nseventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that\\nfavoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained\\nher five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private\\nin  Life Guards had heralded  sublime appearance by announcing\\nthat arrangements were made for  swallowing up of London and\\nWestminster. Even  Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen\\nof years, after rapping out its messages, as  spirits of this\\nvery year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped\\nout theirs. Mere messages in  earthly order of events had lately\\ncome to  English Crown and People, from a congress of British\\nsubjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more\\nimportant to  human race than any communications yet received\\nthrough any of  chickens of  Cock-lane brood.\\n  France, less favoured on  whole as to matters spiritual than\\nher sister of  shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness\\ndown hill, making paper money and spending it. Under  guidance of\\nher Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such\\nhumane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off,\\nhis tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because\\nhe had not kneeled down in  rain to do honour to a dirty procession\\nof monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty\\nor sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in  woods of\\nFrance and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was\\nput to death, already marked by  Woodman, Fate, to come down and be\\nsawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack\\nand a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in\\n rough outhouses of some tillers of  heavy lands adjacent to\\nParis, there were sheltered from  weather that very day, rude\\ncarts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and\\nroosted in by poultry, which  Farmer, Death, had already set\\napart to be his tumbrils of  Revolution. But that Woodman and\\nthat Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently and no one\\nheard them as they went about with muffled tread:  rather,\\nforasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to\\nbe atheistical and traitorous.\\n  In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection\\nto justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\\nhighway robberies, took place in  capital itself every night;\\nfamilies were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without\\nremoving their furniture to upholsterers\\' warehouses for security; \\nhighwayman in  dark was a City tradesman in  light, and, being\\nrecognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in\\nhis character of \" Captain,\" gallantly shot him through  head\\nand rode away;  mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and  guard\\nshot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by  other four, \"in\\nconsequence of  failure of his ammunition:\" after which  mail\\nwas robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate,  Lord Mayor of\\nLondon, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one\\nhighwayman, who despoiled  illustrious creature in sight of all his\\nretinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their\\nturkeys, and  majesty of  law fired blunderbusses in among them,\\nloaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond\\ncrosses from  necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms;\\nmusketeers went into St. Giles\\'s, to search for contraband goods,\\nand  mob fired on  musketeers, and  musketeers fir on \\nmob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of \\ncommon way. In  midst of them,  hangman, ever busy and ever\\nworse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up\\nlong rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on\\nSaturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in \\nhand at Newgate by  dozen, and now burning pamphlets at  door of\\nWestminster Hall; to-day, taking  life of an atrocious murderer,\\nand to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer\\'s boy\\nof sixpence.\\n  All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and\\nclose upon  dear old year one thousand seven hundred and\\nseventy-five. Environed by them, while  Woodman and  Farmer\\nworked unheeded, those two of  large jaws, and those other two of\\n plain and  fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their\\ndivine rights with a high hand. Thus did  year one thousand seven\\nhundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of\\nsmall creatures-  creatures of this chronicle among  rest- along\\n roads that lay before them.\\n  II\\n  THE MAIL\\n\\n  IT WAS  Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in\\nNovember, before  first of  persons with whom this history has\\nbusiness. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond  Dover mail, as\\nit lumbered up Shooter\\'s Hill. He walked up hill in  mire by \\nside of  mail, as  rest of  passengers did; not because\\nthey had  least relish for walking exercise, under \\ncircumstances, but because  hill, and  harness, and  mud, and\\n mail, were all so heavy, that  horses had three times already\\ncome to a stop, besides once drawing  coach across  road, with\\n mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip\\nand coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article\\nof war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of \\nargument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and  team\\nhad capitulated and returned to their duty.\\n  With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way\\nthrough  thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if\\nthey were falling to pieces at  larger joints. As often as \\ndriver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary \"Wo-ho!\\nso-ho-then!\"  near leader violently shook his head and everything\\nupon it- like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that  coach\\ncould be got up  hill. Whenever  leader made this rattle, \\npassenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed\\nin mind.\\n  There was a steaming mist in all  hollows, and it had roamed in\\nits forlornness up  hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and\\nfinding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way\\nthrough  air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one\\nanother, as  waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense\\nenough to shut out everything from  light of  coach-lamps but\\nthese its own workings, and a few yards of road; and  reek of \\nlabouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.\\n  Two other passengers, besides  one, were plodding up  hill\\nby  side of  mail. All three were wrapped to  cheekbones\\nand over  cars, and wore jack-boots. Not one of  three could\\nhave said, from anything he saw, what either of  other two was\\nlike; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from \\neyes of  mind, as from  eyes of  body, of his two companions.\\nIn those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a\\nshort notice, for anybody on  road might be a robber or in league\\nwith robbers. As to  latter, when every posting-house and ale-house\\ncould produce somebody in \" Captain\\'s\" pay, ranging from \\nlandlord to  lowest stable nondescript, it was  likeliest\\nthing upon  cards. So  guard of  Dover mail thought to\\nhimself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and\\nseventy-five, lumbering up Shooter\\'s Hill, as he stood on his own\\nparticular perch behind  mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye\\nand a hand on  arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay\\nat  top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a\\nsubstratum of cutlass.\\n  The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that  guard\\nsuspected  passengers,  passengers suspected one another and \\nguard, they all suspected everybody else, and  coachman was sure of\\nnothing but  horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear\\nconscience have taken his oath on  two Testaments that they were\\nnot fit for  journey.\\n  \"Wo-ho!\" said  coachman. \"So, then! One more pull and you\\'re at\\n top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you\\nto it!- Joe!\"\\n  \"Halloa!\"  guard replied.\\n  \"What o\\'clock do you make it, Joe?\"\\n  \"Ten minutes, good, past eleven.\"\\n  \"My blood!\" ejaculated  vexed coachman, \"and not atop of\\nShooter\\'s yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!\"\\n  The emphatic horse, cut short by  whip in a most decided\\nnegative, made a decided scramble for it, and  three other horses\\nfollowed suit. Once more,  Dover mail struggled on, with \\njack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had\\nstopped when  coach stopped, and they kept close company with it.\\nIf any one of  three had had  hardihood to propose to another to\\nwalk on a little ahead into  mist and darkness, he would have put\\nhimself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.\\n  The last burst carried  mail to  summit of  hill. The\\nhorses stopped to breathe again, and  guard got down to skid \\nwheel for  descent, and open  coach-door to let  passengers\\nin.\\n  \"Tst! Joe!\" cried  coachman in a warning voice, looking down from\\nhis box.\\n  \"What do you say, Tom?\"\\n  They both listened.\\n  \"I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.\"\\n  \"I say a horse at a gallop, Tom,\" returned  guard, leaving his\\nhold of  door, and mounting nimbly to his place. \"Gentlemen! In \\nking\\'s name, all of you!\"\\n  With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood\\non  offensive.\\n  The passenger booked by this history, was on  coach-step, getting\\nin;  two other passengers were close behind him, and about to\\nfollow. He remained on  step, half in  coach and half out of;\\nthey remained in  road below him. They all looked from  coachman\\nto  guard, and from  guard to  coachman, and listened. The\\ncoachman looked back and  guard looked back, and even \\nemphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without\\ncontradicting.\\n  The stillness consequent on  cessation of  rumbling and\\nlabouring of  coach, added to  stillness of  night, made it\\nvery quiet indeed. The panting of  horses communicated a\\ntremulous motion to  coach, as if it were in a state of\\nagitation. The hearts of  passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be\\nheard; but at any rate,  quiet pause was audibly expressive of\\npeople out of breath, and holding  breath, and having  pulses\\nquickened by expectation.\\n  The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up \\nhill.\\n  \"So-ho!\"  guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. \"Yo there!\\nStand! I shall fire!\"\\n  The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and\\nfloundering, a man\\'s voice called from  mist, \"Is that  Dover\\nmail?\"\\n  \"Never you mind what it is!\"  guard retorted. \"What are you?\"\\n  \"Is that  Dover mail?\"\\n  \"Why do you want to know?\"\\n  \"I want a passenger, if it is.\"\\n  \"What passenger?\"\\n  \"Mr. Jarvis Lorry.\"\\n  Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The\\nguard,  coachman, and  two other passengers eyed him\\ndistrustfully.\\n  \"Keep where you are,\"  guard called to  voice in  mist,\\n\"because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in\\nyour lifetime. Gentleman of  name of Lorry answer straight.\"\\n  \"What is  matter?\" asked  passenger, then, with mildly\\nquavering speech. \"Who wants me? Is it Jerry?\"\\n  (\"I don\\'t like Jerry\\'s voice, if it is Jerry,\" growled  guard\\nto himself. \"He\\'s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.\")\\n  \"Yes, Mr. Lorry.\"\\n  \"What is  matter?\"\\n  \"A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.\"\\n  \"I know this messenger, guard,\" said Mr. Lorry, getting down into\\n road- assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by  other\\ntwo passengers, who immediately scrambled into  coach, shut \\ndoor, and pulled up  window. \"He may come close; there\\'s nothing\\nwrong.\"\\n  \"I hope there ain\\'t, but I can\\'t make so \\'Nation sure of that,\" said\\n guard, in gruff soliloquy. \"Hallo you!\"\\n  \"Well! And hallo you!\" said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.\\n  \"Come on at a footpace! d\\'ye mind me? And if you\\'ve got holsters\\nto that saddle o\\' yourn, don\\'t let me see your hand go nigh \\'em. For\\nI\\'m a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes \\nform of Lead. So now let\\'s look at you.\"\\n  The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through  eddying\\nmist, and came to  side of  mail, where  passenger stood. The\\nrider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at  guard, handed \\npassenger a small folded paper. The rider\\'s horse was blown, and\\nboth horse and rider were covered with mud, from  hoofs of \\nhorse to  hat of  man.\\n  \"Guard!\" said  passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.\\n  The watchful guard, with his right hand at  stock of his raised\\nblunderbuss, his left at  barrel, and his eye on  horseman,\\nanswered curtly, \"Sir.\"\\n  \"There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson\\'s Bank. You must\\nknow Tellson\\'s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A\\ncrown to drink. I may read this?\"\\n  \"If so be as you\\'re quick, sir.\"\\n  He opened it in  light of  coach-lamp on that side, and\\nread- first to himself and then aloud: \"\\'Wait at Dover for Mam\\'selle.\\'\\nIt\\'s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED\\nTO LIFE.\"\\n  Jerry started in his saddle. \"That\\'s a Blazing strange answer, too,\"\\nsaid he, at his hoarsest.\\n  \"Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as\\nwell as if I wrote. Make  best of your way. Good night.\"\\n  With those words  passenger opened  coach-door and got in; not\\nat all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously\\nsecreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now\\nmaking a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite\\npurpose than to escape  hazard of originating any other kind of\\naction.\\n  The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing\\nround it as it began  descent. The guard soon replaced his\\nblunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to  rest of its\\ncontents, and having looked to  supplementary pistols that he\\nwore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which\\nthere were a few smith\\'s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box.\\nFor he was furnished with that completeness that if  coach-lamps\\nhad been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he\\nhad only to shut himself up inside, keep  flint and steel sparks\\nwell off  straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if\\nhe were lucky) in five minutes.\\n  \"Tom!\" softly over  coach roof.\\n  \"Hallo, Joe.\"\\n  \"Did you hear  message?\"\\n  \"I did, Joe.\"\\n  \"What did you make of it, Tom?\"\\n  \"Nothing at all, Joe.\"\\n  \"That\\'s a coincidence, too,\"  guard mused, \"for I made  same\\nof it myself.\"\\n  Jerry, left alone in  mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile,\\nnot only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe  mud from his face,\\nand shake  wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of\\nholding about half a gallon. After standing with  bridle over his\\nheavily-splashed arm, until  wheels of  mail were no longer\\nwithin hearing and  night was quite still again, he turned to\\nwalk down  hill.\\n  \"After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won\\'t trust\\nyour fore-legs till I get you on  level,\" said this hoarse\\nmessenger, glancing at his mare. \"\\'Recalled to life.\\' That\\'s a Blazing\\nstrange message. Much of that wouldn\\'t do for you, Jerry! I say,\\nJerry! You\\'d be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come\\ninto fashion, Jerry!\"\\n  III\\n  THE NIGHT SHADOWS\\n\\n  A WONDERFUL FACT to reflect upon, that every human creature is\\nconstituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A\\nsolemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every\\none of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that\\nevery room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every\\nbeating heart in  hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in\\nsome of its imaginings, a secret to  heart nearest it! Something of\\n awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can\\nI turn  leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in\\ntime to read it all. No more can I look into  depths of this\\nunfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I\\nhave had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It\\nwas appointed that  book should shut with a spring, for ever and\\nfor ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that \\nwater should be locked in an eternal frost, when  light was playing\\non its surface, and I stood in ignorance on  shore. My friend is\\ndead, my neighbour is dead, my love,  darling of my soul, is\\ndead; it is  inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of \\nsecret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall\\ncarry in mine to my life\\'s end. In any of  burial-places of this\\ncity through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than\\nits busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or\\nthan I am to them?\\n  As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, \\nmessenger on horseback had exactly  same possessions as  King,\\n first Minister of State, or  richest merchant in London. So\\nwith  three passengers shut up in  narrow compass of one\\nlumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as\\ncomplete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own\\ncoach and sixty, with  breadth of a county between him and \\nnext.\\n  The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at\\nalehouses by  way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own\\ncounsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that\\nassorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black,\\nwith no depth in  colour or form, and much too near together- as if\\nthey were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept\\ntoo far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat\\nlike a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for \\nchin and throat, which descended nearly to  wearer\\'s knees. When he\\nstopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only\\nwhile he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was\\ndone, he muffled again.\\n  \"No, Jerry, no!\" said  messenger, harping on one theme as he\\nrode. \"It wouldn\\'t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman,\\nit wouldn\\'t suit your line of business! Recalled-! Bust me if I\\ndon\\'t think he\\'d been a drinking!\"\\n  His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain,\\nseveral times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on\\n crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing\\njaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt\\nnose. It was so like Smith\\'s work, so much more like  top of a\\nstrongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that  best of players\\nat leap-frog might have declined him, as  most dangerous man in \\nworld to go over.\\n  While he trotted back with  message he was to deliver to \\nnight watchman in his box at  door of Tellson\\'s Bank, by Temple\\nBar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, \\nshadows of  night took such shapes to him as arose out of \\nmessage, and took such shapes to  mare as arose out of her\\nprivate topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she\\nshied at every shadow on  road.\\n  What time,  mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon\\nits tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,\\nlikewise,  shadows of  night revealed themselves, in  forms\\ntheir dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.\\n  Tellson\\'s Bank had a run upon it in  mail. As  bank passenger-\\nwith an arm drawn through  leathern strap, which did what lay in it\\nto keep him from pounding against  next passenger, and driving\\nhim into his corner, whenever  coach got a special jolt- nodded in\\nhis place, with half-shut eyes,  little coach-windows, and \\ncoach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and  bulky bundle of\\nopposite passenger, became  bank, and did a great stroke of\\nbusiness. The rattle of  harness was  chink of money, and more\\ndrafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson\\'s with all\\nits foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice  time. Then\\n strong-rooms underground, at Tellson\\'s, with such of their\\nvaluable stores and secrets as were known to  passenger (and it was\\nnot a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he\\nwent in among them with  great keys and  feebly-burning\\ncandle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as\\nhe had last seen them.\\n  But, though  bank was almost always with him, and though \\ncoach (in a confused way, like  presence of pain under an opiate)\\nwas always with him, there was another current of impression that\\nnever ceased to run, all through  night. He was on his way to dig\\nsome one out of a grave.\\n  Now, which of  multitude of faces that showed themselves before\\nhim was  true face of  buried person,  shadows of  night\\ndid not indicate; but they were all  faces of a man of\\nfive-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in  passions\\nthey expressed, and in  ghastliness of their worn and wasted state.\\nPride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation,\\nsucceeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous\\ncolour, emaciated hands and figures. But  face was in  main\\none face, and every head was prematurely white. A hundred times \\ndozing passenger inquired of this spectre:\\n  \"Buried how long?\"\\n  The answer was always  same: \"Almost eighteen years.\"\\n  \"You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\"\\n  \"Long ago.\"\\n  \"You know that you are recalled to life?\"\\n  \"They tell me so.\"\\n  \"I hope you care to live?\"\\n  \"I can\\'t say.\"\\n  \"Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?\"\\n  The answers to this question were various and contradictory.\\nSometimes  broken reply was, \"Wait! It would kill me if I saw her\\ntoo soon.\" Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then\\nit was, \"Take me to her.\" Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and\\nthen it was, \"I don\\'t know her. I don\\'t understand.\"\\n  After such imaginary discourse,  passenger in his fancy would\\ndig, and dig, dig- now with a spade, now with a great key, now with\\nhis hands- to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with\\nearth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fall away\\nto dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower \\nwindow, to get  reality of mist and rain on his cheek.\\n  Yet even when his eyes were opened on  mist and rain, on \\nmoving patch of light from  lamps, and  hedge at  roadside\\nretreating by jerks,  night shadows outside  coach would fall\\ninto  train of  night shadows within. The real Banking-house\\nby Temple Bar,  real business of  past day,  real strong\\nrooms,  real express sent after him, and  real message returned,\\nwould all be there. Out of  midst of them,  ghostly face would\\nrise, and he would accost it again.\\n  \"Buried how long?\"\\n  \"Almost eighteen years.\"\\n  \"I hope you care to live?\"\\n  \"I can\\'t say.\"\\n  Dig- dig- dig- until an impatient movement from one of  two\\npassengers would admonish him to pull up  window, draw his arm\\nsecurely through  leathern strap, and speculate upon  two\\nslumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again\\nslid away into  bank and  grave.\\n  \"Buried how long?\"\\n  \"Almost eighteen years.\"\\n  \"You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\"\\n  \"Long ago.\"\\n  The words were still in his hearing as just spoken- distinctly in\\nhis hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life- when \\nweary passenger started to  consciousness of daylight, and found\\nthat  shadows of  night were gone.\\n  He lowered  window, and looked out at  rising sun. There was a\\nridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left\\nlast night when  horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,\\nin which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained\\nupon  trees. Though  earth was cold and wet,  sky was\\nclear, and  sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.\\n  \"Eighteen years!\" said  passenger, looking at  sun.\\n\"Gracious Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!\"\\n  IV\\n  THE PREPARATION\\n\\n  WHEN THE MAIL got successfully to Dover, in  course of \\nforenoon,  head drawer at  Royal George Hotel opened \\ncoach-door as his custom was. He did it with some flourish of\\nceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an\\nachievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.\\n  By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left to be\\ncongratulated: for  two others had been set down at their\\nrespective roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of  coach,\\nwith its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its\\nobscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, \\npassenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of\\nshaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger\\nsort of dog.\\n  \"There will be a packet to Calais, to-morrow, drawer?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir, if  weather holds and  wind sets tolerable fair.\\nThe tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in  afternoon,\\nsir. Bed, sir?\"\\n  \"I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a\\nbarber.\"\\n  \"And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.\\nShow Concord! Gentleman\\'s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off\\ngentleman\\'s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire,\\nsir.) Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!\"\\n  The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by\\n mail, and passengers by  mail being always heavily wrapped up\\nfrom head to foot,  room had  odd interest for  establishment\\nof  Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to\\ngo into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it.\\nConsequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and\\n landlady, were an loitering by accident at various points of \\nroad between  Concord and  coffee-room, when a gentleman of\\nsixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well\\nworn. but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to\\n pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.\\n  The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than \\ngentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before  fire, and\\nas he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for  meal, he sat\\nso still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.\\n  Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and\\na loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as\\nthough it pitted its gravity and longevity against  levity and\\nevanescence of  brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little\\nvain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were\\nof a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were\\ntrim. He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close\\nto his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but\\nwhich looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or\\nglass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his\\nstockings, was as white as  tops of  waves that broke upon \\nneighbouring beach, or  specks of sail that glinted in  sunlight\\nfar at sea. A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still\\nlighted up under  quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it\\nmust have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to\\n composed and reserved expression of Tellson\\'s Bank. He had a\\nhealthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few\\ntraces of anxiety. But, perhaps  confidential bachelor clerks in\\nTellson\\'s Bank were principally occupied with  cares of other\\npeople; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes,\\ncome easily off and on.\\n  Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his\\nportrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast\\nroused him, and he said to  drawer, as he moved his chair to it:\\n  \"I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at\\nany time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask\\nfor a gentleman from Tellson\\'s Bank. Please to let me know.\"\\n  \"Yes, sir. Tellson\\'s Bank in London, sir?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"Yes, sir. We have oftentimes  honour to entertain your gentlemen\\nin their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris,\\nsir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company\\'s House.\"\\n  \"Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.\"\\n  \"Yes, sir. Not much in  habit of such travelling yourself, I\\nthink, sir?\"\\n  \"Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we-since I- came\\nlast from France.\"\\n  \"Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people\\'s\\ntime here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.\"\\n  \"I believe so.\"\\n  \"But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and\\nCompany was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen\\nyears ago?\"\\n  \"You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be\\nfar from  truth.\"\\n  \"Indeed, sir!\"\\n  Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from\\n table,  waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his\\nleft, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying \\nguest while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower.\\nAccording to  immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.\\n  When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a\\nstroll on  beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid\\nitself away from  beach, and ran its head into  chalk cliffs,\\nlike a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and\\nstones tumbling wildly about, and  sea did what it liked, and\\nwhat it liked was destruction. It thundered at  town, and thundered\\nat  cliffs, and brought  coast down, madly. The air among \\nhouses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have\\nsupposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went\\ndown to be dipped in  sea. A little fishing was done in  port,\\nand a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward:\\nparticularly at those times when  tide made, and was near flood.\\nSmall tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably\\nrealised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in \\nneighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\\n  As  day declined into  afternoon, and  air, which had\\nbeen at intervals clear enough to allow  French coast to be seen,\\nbecame again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry\\'s thoughts seemed\\nto cloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before  coffee-room\\nfire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind\\nwas busily digging, digging, digging, in  live red coals.\\n  A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in  red\\ncoals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of\\nwork. Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his\\nlast glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction\\nas is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion\\nwho has got to  end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came\\nup  narrow street, and rumbled into  inn-yard.\\n  He set down his glass untouched. \"This is Mam\\'selle!\" said he.\\n  In a very few minutes  waiter came in to announce that Miss\\nManette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see \\ngentleman from Tellson\\'s.\\n  \"So soon?\"\\n  Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on  road, and required\\nnone then, and was extremely anxious to see  gentleman from\\nTellson\\'s immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.\\n  The gentleman from Tellson\\'s had nothing left for it but to empty\\nhis glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little\\nflaxen wig at  ears, and follow  waiter to Miss Manette\\'s\\napartment. It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner\\nwith black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had\\nbeen oiled and oiled, until  two tall candles on  table in \\nmiddle of  room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if they\\nwere buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak\\nof could be expected from them until they were dug out.\\n  The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry,\\npicking his way over  well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss\\nManette to be, for  moment, in some adjacent room, until, having\\ngot past  two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him by \\ntable between them and  fire, a young lady of not more than\\nseventeen in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw\\ntravelling-hat by its ribbon in her band. As his eyes rested on a\\nshort, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of\\nblue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with\\na singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of\\nlifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite\\none of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed\\nattention, though it included all  four expressions- as his eyes\\nrested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,\\nof a child whom he had held in his arms on  passage across that\\nvery Channel, one cold time, when  hail drifted heavily and  sea\\nran high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along  surface of\\n gaunt pier-glass behind her, on  frame of which, a hospital\\nprocession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were\\noffering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of \\nfeminine gender- and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.\\n  \"Pray take a seat, sir.\" In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a\\nlittle foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.\\n  \"I kiss your hand, miss,\" said Mr. Lorry, with  manners of an\\nearlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.\\n  \"I received a letter from  Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me\\nthat some intelligence- or discovery--\"\\n  \"The word is not material, miss; either word will do.\"\\n   \"-respecting  small property of my poor father, whom I never\\nsaw- so long dead-\"\\n  Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards \\nhospital procession of negro cupids. As if they had any help for\\nanybody in their absurd baskets!\\n  \"-rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to\\ncommunicate with a gentleman of  Bank, so good as to be\\ndespatched to Paris for  purpose.\"\\n  \"Myself.\"\\n  \"As I was prepared to hear, sir.\"\\n  She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days),\\nwith a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and\\nwiser he was than she. He made her another bow.\\n  \"I replied to  Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by\\nthose who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should\\ngo to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who\\ncould go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to\\nplace myself, during  journey, under that worthy gentleman\\'s\\nprotection. The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was\\nsent after him to be,  favour of his waiting for me here.\"\\n  \"I was happy,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"to be entrusted with  charge. I\\nshall be more happy to execute it.\"\\n  \"Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told\\nme by  Bank that  gentleman would explain to me  details of\\n business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a\\nsurprising nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I\\nnaturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.\"\\n  \"Naturally,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Yes- I--\"\\n  After a pause, he added, again settling  crisp flaxen wig at\\n ears,\\n  \"It is very difficult to begin.\"\\n  He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The\\nyoung forehead lifted itself into that singular expression- but it was\\npretty and characteristic, besides being singular- and she raised\\nher hand, as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed\\nsome passing shadow.\\n  \"Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?\"\\n  \"Am I not?\" Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards\\nwith an argumentative smile.\\n  Between  eyebrows and just over  little feminine nose, \\nline of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, \\nexpression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in \\nchair by which she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as\\nshe mused, and  moment she raised her eyes again, went on:\\n  \"In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address\\nyou as a young English lady, Miss Manette?\"\\n  \"If you please, sir.\"\\n  Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to\\nacquit myself of. In your reception of it, don\\'t heed me any more than\\nif I was a speaking machine- truly, I am not much else. I will, with\\nyour leave, relate to you, miss,  story of one of our customers.\"\\n  \"Story!\"\\n  He seemed wilfully to mistake  word she had repeated, when he\\nadded, in a hurry, \"Yes, customers; in  banking business we usually\\ncall our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a\\nscientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements- a Doctor.\"\\n  \"Not of Beauvais?\"\\n  Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, \\ngentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, \\ngentleman was of repute in Paris. I had  honour of knowing him\\nthere. Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I\\nwas at that time in our French House, and had been- oh! twenty years.\"\\n  \"At that time- I may ask, at what time, sir?\"\\n  \"I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married- an English lady-\\nand I was one of  trustees. His affairs, like  affairs of many\\nother French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson\\'s\\nhands. In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or\\nother for scores of our customers. These are mere business\\nrelations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular\\ninterest, nothing like sentiment. I have passed from one to another,\\nin  course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our\\ncustomers to another in  course of my business day; in short, I\\nhave no feelings; I am a mere machine. To go on--\"\\n  \"But this is my father\\'s story, sir; and I begin to think\"- \\ncuriously roughened forehead was very intent upon him- \"that when I\\nwas left an orphan through my mother\\'s surviving my father only two\\nyears, it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was\\nyou.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry took  hesitating little hand that confidingly\\nadvanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He\\nthen conducted  young lady straightway to her chair again, and,\\nholding  chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by\\nturns to rub his chin, pull his wig at  ears, or point what he\\nsaid, stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into\\nhis.\\n  \"Miss Manette, it was I. And you will see how truly I spoke of\\nmyself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all \\nrelations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations,\\nwhen you reflect that I have never seen you since. No; you have been\\n ward of Tellson\\'s House since, and I have been busy with  other\\nbusiness of Tellson\\'s House since. Feelings! I have no time for\\nthem, no chance of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an\\nimmense pecuniary Mangle.\"\\n  After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr.\\nLorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which\\nwas most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining\\nsurface was before), and resumed his former attitude.\\n  \"So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is  story of your\\nregretted father. Now comes  difference. If your father had not\\ndied when he did-- Don\\'t be frightened! How you start!\"\\n  She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her\\nhands.\\n  \"Pray,\" said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand\\nfrom  back of  chair to lay it on  supplicatory fingers\\nthat clasped him in so violent a tremble: \"pray control your\\nagitation- a matter of business. As I was saying--\"\\n  Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began\\nanew:\\n  \"As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had\\nsuddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it\\nhad not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no\\nart could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could\\nexercise a privilege that I in my own time have known  boldest\\npeople afraid to speak of in a whisper, across  water there; for\\ninstance,  privilege of filling up blank forms for \\nconsignment of any one to  oblivion of a prison for any length of\\ntime; if his wife had implored  king,  queen,  queen, \\ncourt,  clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;-\\nthen  history of your father would have been  history of this\\nunfortunate gentleman,  Doctor of Beauvais.\"\\n  \"I entreat you to tell me more, sir.\"\\n  \"I will. I am going to. You can bear it?\"\\n  \"I can bear anything but  uncertainty you leave me in at this\\nmoment.\"\\n  \"You speak collectedly, and you- are collected. That\\'s good!\"\\n(Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.) \"A matter of\\nbusiness. Regard it as a matter of business- business that must be\\ndone. Now if this doctor\\'s wife, though a lady of great courage and\\nspirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little\\nchild was born--\"\\n  \"The little child was a daughter, sir.\"\\n  \"A daughter. A- a- matter of business- don\\'t be distressed. Miss, if\\n poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was\\nborn, that she came to  determination of sparing  poor child \\ninheritance of any part of  agony she had known  pains of, by\\nrearing her in  belief that her father was dead-- No, don\\'t\\nkneel! In Heaven\\'s name why should you kneel to me!\"\\n  \"For  truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for  truth!\"\\n  \"A- a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact\\nbusiness if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly\\nmention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how\\nmany shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should\\nbe so much more at my ease about your state of mind.\"\\n  Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when\\nhe had very gently raised her, and  hands that had not ceased to\\nclasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she\\ncommunicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.\\n  \"That\\'s right, that\\'s right. Courage! Business! You have business\\nbefore you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this\\ncourse with you. And when she died- I believe broken-hearted- having\\nnever slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you,\\nat two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy,\\nwithout  dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether\\nyour father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through\\nmany lingering years.\"\\n  As he said  words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on \\nflowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have\\nbeen already tinged with grey.\\n  \"You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what\\nthey had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no\\nnew discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--\"\\n  He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in \\nforehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which\\nwas now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.\\n  \"But he has been- been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is\\ntoo probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope\\n best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to  house of\\nan old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if\\nI can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.\"\\n  A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said,\\nin a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in\\na dream,\\n  \"I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost- not him!\"\\n  Mr. Lorry quietly chafed  hands that held his arm. \"There, there,\\nthere! See now, see now! The best and  worst are known to you, now.\\nYou are well on your way to  poor wronged gentleman, and, with a\\nfair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear\\nside.\"\\n  She repeated in  same tone, sunk to a whisper, \"I have been free,\\nI have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!\"\\n  \"Only one thing more,\" said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a\\nwholesome means of enforcing her attention: \"he has been found under\\nanother name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be\\nworse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to\\nknow whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly\\nheld prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any\\ninquiries, because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention \\nsubject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him- for a while at all\\nevents- out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even\\nTellson\\'s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of\\n matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly\\nreferring to it. This is a secret service altogether. My\\ncredentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in  one\\nline, \\'Recalled to Life;\\' which may mean anything. But what is \\nmatter! She doesn\\'t notice a word! Miss Manette!\"\\n  Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair,\\nshe sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and\\nfixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were\\ncarved or branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his\\narm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her;\\ntherefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.\\n  A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed\\nto be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed\\nin some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a\\nmost wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good\\nmeasure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into  room\\nin advance of  inn servants, and soon settled  question of his\\ndetachment from  poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon\\nhis chest, and sending him flying back against  nearest wall.\\n  (\"I really think this must be a man!\" was Mr. Lorry\\'s breathless\\nreflection, simultaneously with his coming against  wall.)\\n  \"Why, look at you all!\" bawled this figure, addressing  inn\\nservants. \"Why don\\'t you go and fetch things, instead of standing\\nthere staring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don\\'t\\nyou go and fetch things? I\\'ll let you know, if you don\\'t bring\\nsmelling-salts, cold water, and quick, I will.\"\\n  There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she\\nsoftly laid  patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and\\ngentleness: calling her \"my precious!\" and \"my bird!\" and spreading\\nher golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.\\n  \"And you in brown!\" she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;\\n\"couldn\\'t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening\\nher to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold\\nhands. Do you call that being a Banker?\"\\n  Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to\\nanswer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler\\nsympathy and humility, while  strong woman, having banished  inn\\nservants under  mysterious penalty of \"letting them know\" something\\nnot mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a\\nregular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping\\nhead upon her shoulder.\\n  \"I hope she will do well now,\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!\"\\n  \"I hope,\" said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and\\nhumility, \"that you accompany Miss Manette to France?\"\\n  \"A likely thing, too!\" replied  strong woman. \"If it was ever\\nintended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence\\nwould have cast my lot in an island?\"\\n  This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry\\nwithdrew to consider it.\\n  V\\n  THE WINE-SHOP\\n\\n  A LARGE CASK of wine had been dropped and broken, in  street. The\\naccident had happened in getting it out of a cart;  cask had\\ntumbled out with a run,  hoops had burst, and it lay on \\nstones just outside  door of  wine-shop, shattered like a\\nwalnut-shell.\\n  All  people within reach had suspended their business, or their\\nidleness, to run to  spot and drink  wine. The rough,\\nirregular stones of  street, pointing every way, and designed,\\none might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that\\napproached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were\\nsurrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to\\nits size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands\\njoined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their\\nshoulders, to sip, before  wine had all run out between their\\nfingers. Others, men and women, dipped in  puddles with little mugs\\nof mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women\\'s\\nheads, which were squeezed dry into infants\\' mouths; others made small\\nmud-embankments, to stern  wine as it ran; others, directed by\\nlookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off\\nlittle streams of wine that started away in new directions; others\\ndevoted themselves to  sodden and lee-dyed pieces of  cask,\\nlicking, and even champing  moister wine-rotted fragments with\\neager relish. There was no drainage to carry off  wine, and not\\nonly did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along\\nwith it, that there might have been a scavenger in  street, if\\nanybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous\\npresence.\\n  A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices- voices of men,\\nwomen, and children- resounded in  street while this wine game\\nlasted. There was little roughness in  sport, and much playfulness.\\nThere was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination\\non  part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially\\namong  luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking\\nof healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a\\ndozen together. When  wine was gone, and  places where it had\\nbeen most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers,\\nthese demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The\\nman who had left his saw sticking in  firewood he was cutting,\\nset it in motion again;  women who had left on a door-step \\nlittle pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften \\npain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child,\\nreturned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous\\nfaces, who had emerged into  winter light from cellars, moved away,\\nto descend again; and a gloom gathered on  scene that appeared more\\nnatural to it than sunshine.\\n  The wine was red wine, and had stained  ground of  narrow\\nstreet in  suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled.\\nIt had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet,\\nand many wooden shoes. The hands of  man who sawed  wood, left\\nred marks on  billets; and  forehead of  woman who nursed her\\nbaby, was stained with  stain of  old rag she wound about her\\nhead again. Those who had been greedy with  staves of  cask, had\\nacquired a tigerish smear about  mouth; and one tall joker so\\nbesmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than\\nin it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees-\\nBLOOD.\\n  The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on \\nstreet-stones, and when  stain of it would be red upon many there.\\n  And now that  cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary\\ngleam had driven from his sacred countenance,  darkness of it was\\nheavy- cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were  lords in\\nwaiting on  saintly presence- nobles of great power all of them;\\nbut, most especially  last. Samples of a people that had\\nundergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in  mill, and\\ncertainly not in  fabulous mill which ground old people young,\\nshivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked\\nfrom every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that \\nwind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was  mill that\\ngrinds young people old;  children had ancient faces and grave\\nvoices; and upon them, and upon  grown faces, and ploughed into\\nevery furrow of age and coming up afresh, was  sigh, Hunger. It was\\nprevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of  tall houses, in \\nwretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched\\ninto them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated\\nin every fragment of  small modicum of firewood that  man\\nsawed off; Hunger stared down from  smokeless chimneys, and started\\nup from  filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of\\nanything to eat. Hunger was  inscription on  baker\\'s shelves,\\nwritten in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at \\nsausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale.\\nHunger rattled its dry bones among  roasting chestnuts in \\nturned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomies in every farthing\\nporringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of\\noil.\\n  Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding\\nstreet, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding\\nstreets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling\\nof rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look\\nupon them that looked ill. In  hunted air of  people there was\\nyet some wild-beast thought of  possibility of turning at bay.\\nDepressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting\\namong them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed;\\nnor foreheads knitted into  likeness of  gallows-rope they mused\\nabout enduring, or inflicting. The trade sips (and they were almost as\\nmany as  shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The\\nbutcher and  porkman painted up, only  leanest scrags of meat;\\n baker,  coarsest of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured\\nas drinking in  wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of\\nthin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together.\\nNothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and\\nweapons; but,  cutler\\'s knives and axes were sharp and bright,\\n smith\\'s hammers were heavy, and  gunmaker\\'s stock was\\nmurderous. The crippling stones of  pavement, with their many\\nlittle reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off\\nabruptly at  doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down  middle\\nof  street- when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains,\\nand then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into  houses. Across \\nstreets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and\\npulley; at night, when  lamplighter had let these down, and\\nlighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung\\nin a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they\\nwere at sea, and  ship and crew were in peril of tempest.\\n  For,  time was to come, when  gaunt scarecrows of that\\nregion should have watched  lamplighter, in their idleness and\\nhunger, so long, as to conceive  idea of improving on his method,\\nand hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon \\ndarkness of their condition. But,  time was not come yet; and every\\nwind that blew over France shook  rags of  scarecrows in vain,\\nfor  birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.\\n  The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its\\nappearance and degree, and  master of  wine-shop had stood\\noutside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at\\n struggle for  lost wine. \"It\\'s not my affair,\" said he, with\\na final shrug of  shoulders. \"The people from  market did it.\\nLet them bring another.\"\\n  There, his eyes happening to catch  tall joker writing up his\\njoke, he called to him across  way:\\n  \"Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?\"\\n  The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is\\noften  way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely\\nfailed, as is often  way with his tribe too.\\n  \"What now? Are you a subject for  mad hospital?\" said \\nwineshop keeper, crossing  road, and obliterating  jest with a\\nhandful of mud, picked up for  purpose, and smeared over it. \"Why\\ndo you write in  public streets? Is there- tell me thou- is there\\nno other place to write such words in?\"\\n  In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps\\naccidentally, perhaps not) upon  joker\\'s heart. The joker rapped it\\nwith his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a\\nfantastic dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off\\nhis foot into his hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not\\nto say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those\\ncircumstances.\\n  \"Put it on, put it on,\" said  other. \"Call wine, wine; and finish\\nthere.\" With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon  joker\\'s\\ndress, such as it was- quite deliberately, as having dirtied \\nhand on his account; and then recrossed  road and entered \\nwine-shop.\\n  This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of\\nthirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it\\nwas a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his\\nshoulder. His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms\\nwere bare to  elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head\\nthan his own crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man\\naltogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them.\\nGood-humoured looking on  whole, but implacable-looking, too;\\nevidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not\\ndesirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on\\neither side, for nothing would turn  man.\\n  Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in  shop behind  counter as he\\ncame in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with a\\nwatchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand\\nheavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of\\nmanner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one\\nmight have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against\\nherself in any of  reckonings over which she presided. Madame\\nDefarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a\\nquantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to \\nconcealment of her large ear-rings. Her knitting was before her, but\\nshe had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged,\\nwith her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said\\nnothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough.\\nThis, in combination with  lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows\\nover her toothpick by  breadth of a line, suggested to her\\nhusband that he would do well to look round  shop among \\ncustomers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped\\nover  way.\\n  The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they\\nrested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated\\nin a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing\\ndominoes, three standing by  counter lengthening out a short supply\\nof wine. As he passed behind  counter, he took notice that \\nelderly gentleman said in a look to  young lady, \"This is our man.\"\\n  \"What  devil do you do in that galley there?\" said Monsieur\\nDefarge to himself; \"I don\\'t know you.\"\\n  But, he feigned not to notice  two strangers, and fell into\\ndiscourse with  triumvirate of customers who were drinking at \\ncounter.\\n  \"How goes it, Jacques?\" said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge.\\n\"Is all  spilt wine swallowed?\"\\n  \"Every drop, Jacques,\" answered Monsieur Defarge.\\n  When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame\\nDefarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain\\nof cough, and raised her eyebrows by  breadth of another line.\\n  \"It is not often,\" said  second of  three, addressing Monsieur\\nDefarge, \"that many of these miserable beasts know  taste of\\nwine, or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so,\\nJacques?\"\\n  \"It is so, Jacques,\" Monsieur Defarge returned.\\n  At this second interchange of  Christian name, Madame Defarge,\\nstill using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another\\ngrain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by  breadth of another\\nline.\\n  The last of  three now said his say, as he put down his empty\\ndrinking vessel and smacked his lips.\\n  \"Ah! So much  worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle\\nalways have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I\\nright, Jacques?\"\\n  \"You are right, Jacques,\" was  response of Monsieur Defarge.\\n  This third interchange of  Christian name was completed at \\nmoment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up,\\nand slightly rustled in her seat.\\n  \"Hold then! True!\" muttered her husband. \"Gentlemen- my wife!\"\\n  The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with\\nthree flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head,\\nand giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner\\nround  wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness\\nand repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.\\n  \"Gentlemen,\" said her husband, who had kept his bright eye\\nobservantly upon her, \"good day. The chamber, furnished\\nbachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for\\nwhen I stepped out, is on  fifth floor. The doorway of \\nstaircase gives on  little courtyard close to  left here,\"\\npointing with his hand, \"near to  window of my establishment.\\nBut, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can\\nshow  way. Gentlemen, adieu!\"\\n  They paid for their wine, and left  place. The eyes of Monsieur\\nDefarge were studying his wife at her knitting when  elderly\\ngentleman advanced from his corner, and begged  favour of a word.\\n  \"Willingly, sir,\" said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with\\nhim to  door.\\n  Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at \\nfirst word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It\\nhad not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman\\nthen beckoned to  young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame\\nDefarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw\\nnothing.\\n  Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from  wine-shop thus,\\njoined Monsieur Defarge in  doorway to which he had directed his\\nown company just before. It opened from a stinking little black\\ncourtyard, and was  general public entrance to a great pile of\\nhouses, inhabited by a great number of people. In  gloomy\\ntile-paved entry to  gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur\\nDefarge bent down on one knee to  child of his old master, and\\nput her hand to his lips. It was a gentle action, but not at all\\ngently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a\\nfew seconds. He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of\\naspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.\\n  \"It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.\"\\nThus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they\\nbegan ascending  stairs.\\n  \"Is he alone?\"  latter whispered.\\n  \"Alone! God help him, who should be with him!\" said  other, in\\n same low voice.\\n  \"Is he always alone, then?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"Of his own desire?\"\\n  \"Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they\\nfound me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be\\ndiscreet- as he was then, so he is now.\"\\n  \"He is greatly changed?\"\\n  \"Changed!\"\\n  The keeper of  wine-shop stopped to strike  wall with his\\nhand, and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have\\nbeen half so forcible. Mr. Lorry\\'s spirits grew heavier and heavier,\\nas he and his two companions ascended higher and higher.\\n  Such a staircase, with its accessories, in  older and more\\ncrowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it\\nwas vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little\\nhabitation within  great foul nest of one high building- that is to\\nsay,  room or rooms within every door that opened on  general\\nstaircase- left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides\\nflinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and\\nhopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted\\n air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with\\ntheir intangible impurities;  two bad sources combined made it\\nalmost insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark\\nshaft of dirt and poison,  way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance\\nof mind, and to his young companion\\'s agitation, which became\\ngreater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of\\nthese stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any\\nlanguishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape,\\nand all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through \\nrusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of \\njumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower\\nthan  summits of  two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any\\npromise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.\\n  At last,  top of  staircase was gained, and they stopped for\\n third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper\\ninclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before \\ngarret story was reached. The keeper of  wine-shop, always going\\na little in advance, and always going on  side which Mr. Lorry\\ntook, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by  young lady,\\nturned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in  pockets of\\n coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.\\n  \"The door is locked then, my friend?\" said Mr. Lorry, surprised.\\n  \"Ay. Yes,\" was  grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.\\n  \"You think it necessary to keep  unfortunate gentleman so\\nretired?\"\\n  \"I think it necessary to turn  key.\" Monsieur Defarge whispered\\nit closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.\\n  \"Why?\"\\n  \"Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\\nfrightened- rave- tear himself to pieces- die- come to I know not what\\nharm- if his door was left open.\"\\n  \"Is it possible!\" exclaimed Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"Is it possible!\" repeated Defarge, bitterly. \"Yes. And a\\nbeautiful world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other\\nsuch things are possible, and not only possible, but done- done, see\\nyou!- under that sky there, every day. Long live  Devil. Let us\\ngo on.\"\\n  This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a\\nword of it had reached  young lady\\'s ears. But, by this time she\\ntrembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep\\nanxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it\\nincumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\\n  \"Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in\\na moment; it is but passing  room-door, and  worst is over.\\nThen, all  good you bring to him, all  relief, all  happiness\\nyou bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on\\nthat side. That\\'s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business,\\nbusiness!\"\\n  They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they\\nwere soon at  top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came\\nall at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close\\ntogether at  side of a door, and who were intently looking into \\nroom to which  door belonged, through some chinks or holes in \\nwall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and\\nrose, and showed themselves to be  three of one name who had been\\ndrinking in  wine-shop.\\n  \"I forgot them in  surprise of your visit,\" explained Monsieur\\nDefarge. \"Leave us, good boys; we have business here.\"\\n  The three glided by, and went silently down.\\n  There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and  keeper of\\n wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone,\\nMr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\\n  \"Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\"\\n  \"I show him, in  way you have seen, to a chosen few.\"\\n  \"Is that well?\"\\n  \"I think it is well.\"\\n  \"Who are  few? How do you choose them?\"\\n  \"I choose them as real men, of my name- Jacques is my name- to\\nwhom  sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that\\nis another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\"\\n  With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked\\nin through  crevice in  wall. Soon raising his head again, he\\nstruck twice or thrice upon  door- evidently with no other object\\nthan to make a noise there. With  same intention, he drew  key\\nacross it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into \\nlock, and turned it as heavily as he could.\\n  The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into \\nroom and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more\\nthan a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\\n  He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr.\\nLorry got his arm securely round  daughter\\'s waist, and held her;\\nfor he felt that she was sinking.\\n  \"A- a- a- business, business!\" he urged, with a moisture that was\\nnot of business shining on his cheek. \"Come in, come in!\"\\n  \"I am afraid of it,\" she answered, shuddering.\\n  \"Of it? What?\"\\n  \"I mean of him. Of my father.\"\\n  Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by  beckoning of\\ntheir conductor, he drew over his neck  arm that shook upon his\\nshoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into  room. He sat\\nher down just within  door, and held her, clinging to him.\\n  Defarge drew out  key, closed  door, locked it on \\ninside, took out  key again, and held it in his hand. All this he\\ndid, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of\\nnoise as he could make. Finally, he walked across  room with a\\nmeasured tread to where  window was. He stopped there, and faced\\nround.\\n  The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and  like,\\nwas dim and dark: for,  window of dormer shape, was in truth a door\\nin  roof, with a little crane over it for  hoisting up of stores\\nfrom  street: unglazed, and closing up  middle in two pieces,\\nlike any other door of French construction. To exclude  cold, one\\nhalf of this door was fast closed, and  other was opened but a very\\nlittle way. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through\\nthese means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see\\nanything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one,\\n ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet,\\nwork of that kind was being done in  garret; for, with his back\\ntowards  door, and his face towards  window where  keeper\\nof  wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low\\nbench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.\\n  VI\\n  THE SHOEMAKER\\n\\n  \"GOOD DAY!\" said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at  white bead\\nthat bent low over  shoemaking.\\n  It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to\\n salutation, as if it were at a distance:\\n  \"Good day!\"\\n  \"You are still hard at work, I see?\"\\n  After a long silence,  head was lifted for another moment, and\\n voice replied, \"Yes- I am working.\" This time, a pair of haggard\\neyes had looked at  questioner, before  face had dropped again.\\n  The faintness of  voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not \\nfaintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\\ndoubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it\\nwas  faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like  last\\nfeeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost\\n life and resonance of  human voice, that it affected  senses\\nlike a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So\\nsunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So\\nexpressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished\\ntraveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have\\nremembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\\n  Some minutes of silent work had passed: and  haggard eyes had\\nlooked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull\\nmechanical perception, beforehand, that  spot where  only\\nvisitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\\n  \"I want,\" said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from \\nshoemaker, \"to let in a little more light here. You can bear a\\nlittle more?\"\\n  The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of\\nlistening, at  floor on one side of him; then similarly, at \\nfloor on  other side of him; then, upward at  speaker.\\n  \"What did you say?\"\\n  \"You can bear a little more light?\"\\n  \"I must bear it, if you let it in.\" (Laying  palest shadow of a\\nstress upon  second word.)\\n  The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at\\nthat angle for  time. A broad ray of light fell into  garret,\\nand showed  workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing\\nin his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were\\nat his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut,\\nbut not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The\\nhollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look\\nlarge, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though\\nthey had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and\\nlooked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at \\nthroat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old\\ncanvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of\\nclothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded\\ndown to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have\\nbeen hard to say which was which.\\n  He had put up a hand between his eyes and  light, and  very\\nbones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant\\ngaze, pausing in his work. He never looked at  figure before him,\\nwithout first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as\\nif he had lost  habit of associating place with sound; he never\\nspoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to\\nspeak.\\n  \"Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?\" asked\\nDefarge, motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.\\n  \"What did you say?\"\\n  \"Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?\"\\n  \"I can\\'t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don\\'t know.\"\\n  But,  question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it\\nagain.\\n  Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving  daughter by  door.\\nWhen he had stood, for a minute or two, by  side of Defarge, \\nshoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure,\\nbut  unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he\\nlooked at it (his lips and his nails were of  same pale\\nlead-colour), and then  hand dropped to his work, and he once\\nmore bent over  shoe. The look and  action had occupied but an\\ninstant.\\n  \"You have a visitor, you see,\" said Monsieur Defarge.\\n  \"What did you say?\"\\n  \"Here is a visitor.\"\\n  The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand\\nfrom his work.\\n  \"Come!\" said Defarge. \"Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made\\nshoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it,\\nmonsieur.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.\\n  Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and  maker\\'s name.\"\\n  There was a longer pause than usual, before  shoemaker replied:\\n  \"I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?\"\\n  \"I said, couldn\\'t you describe  kind of shoe, for monsieur\\'s\\ninformation?\"\\n  \"It is a lady\\'s shoe. It is a young lady\\'s walking-shoe. It is in\\n present mode. I never saw  mode. I have had a pattern in my\\nhand.\" He glanced at  shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\\n  \"And  maker\\'s name?\" said Defarge.\\n  Now that he had no work to hold, he laid  knuckles of  right\\nhand in  hollow of  left, and then  knuckles of  left hand\\nin  hollow of  right, and then passed a hand across his\\nbearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment\\'s\\nintermission. The task of recalling him from  vagrancy into which\\nhe always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak\\nperson from a swoon, or endeavouring, in  hope of some\\ndisclosure, to stay  spirit of a fast-dying man.\\n  \"Did you ask me for my name?\"\\n  \"Assuredly I did.\"\\n  \"One Hundred and Five, North Tower.\"\\n  \"Is that all?\"\\n  \"One Hundred and Five, North Tower.\"\\n  With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work\\nagain, until  silence was again broken.\\n  \"You are not a shoemaker by trade?\" said Mr. Lorry, looking\\nsteadfastly at him.\\n  His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred\\n question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they\\nturned back on  questioner when they had sought  ground.\\n  \"I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by\\ntrade. I- I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--\"\\n  He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes\\non his hands  whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to\\n face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he\\nstarted, and resumed, in  manner of a sleeper that moment awake,\\nreverting to a subject of last night.\\n  \"I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty\\nafter a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.\"\\n  As he held out his hand for  shoe that had been taken from him,\\nMr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:\\n  \"Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?\"\\n  The shoe dropped to  ground, and he sat looking fixedly at \\nquestioner.\\n  \"Monsieur Manette\"; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge\\'s arm;\\n\"do you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is\\nthere no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time,\\nrising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?\"\\n  As  captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.\\nLorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively\\nintent intelligence in  middle of  forehead, gradually forced\\nthemselves through  black mist that had fallen on him. They were\\noverclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had\\nbeen there. And so exactly was  expression repeated on  fair\\nyoung face of her who had crept along  wall to a point where she\\ncould see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands\\nwhich at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not\\neven to keep him off and shut out  sight of him, but which were now\\nextending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay  spectral\\nface upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope- so\\nexactly was  expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on\\nher fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a\\nmoving light, from him to her.\\n  Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at  two,\\nless and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought\\n ground and looked about him in  old way. Finally, with a deep\\nlong sigh, he took  shoe up, and resumed his work.\\n  \"Have you recognised him, monsieur?\" asked Defarge in a whisper.\\n  \"Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have\\nunquestionably seen, for a single moment,  face that I once knew so\\nwell. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!\"\\n  She had moved from  wall of  garret. very near to  bench on\\nwhich he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of\\n figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he\\nstooped over his labour.\\n  Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a\\nspirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.\\n  It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change \\ninstrument in his hand, for his shoemaker\\'s knife. It lay on that side\\nof him which was not  side on which she stood. He had taken it\\nup, and was stooping to work again, when his eyes caught  skirt\\nof her dress. He raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators\\nstarted forward, but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She\\nhad no fear of his striking at her with  knife, though they had.\\n  He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips\\nbegan to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By\\ndegrees, in  pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was\\nheard to say:\\n  \"What is this?\"\\n  With  tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her\\nlips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if\\nshe laid his ruined head there.\\n  \"You are not  gaoler\\'s daughter?\"\\n  She sighed \"No.\"\\n  \"Who are you?\"\\n  Not yet trusting  tones of her voice, she sat down on  bench\\nbeside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange\\nthrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his\\nframe; he laid  knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.\\n  Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly\\npushed aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by\\nlittle and little, he took it up and looked at it. In  midst of \\naction he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at\\nhis shoemaking.\\n  But not for long. Releasing his ann, she laid her hand upon his\\nshoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to\\nbe sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his\\nhand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of\\nfolded rag attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and\\nit contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or\\ntwo long golden hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon\\nhis finger.\\n  He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it.\\n\"It is  same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!\"\\n  As  concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed\\nto become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to \\nlight, and looked at her.\\n  \"She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was\\nsummoned out- she had a fear of my going, though I had none- and\\nwhen I was brought to  North Tower they found these upon my sleeve.\\n\\'You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in  body,\\nthough they may in  spirit.\\' Those were  words I said. I\\nremember them very well.\"\\n  He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter\\nit. But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him\\ncoherently, though slowly.\\n  \"How was this?- Was it you?\"\\n  Once more,  two spectators started, as he turned upon her with\\na frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp,\\nand only said, in a low voice, \"I entreat you, good gentlemen, do\\nnot come near us, do not speak, do not move!\"\\n  \"Hark!\" he exclaimed. \"Whose voice was that?\"\\n  His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his\\nwhite hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything\\nbut his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little\\npacket and tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at\\nher, and gloomily shook his head.\\n  \"No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can\\'t be. See\\nwhat  prisoner is. These are not  hands she knew, this is not\\n face she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She\\nwas- and He was- before  slow years of  North Tower- ages ago.\\nWhat is your name, my gentle angel?\"\\n  Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her\\nknees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.\\n  \"O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother\\nwas, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history.\\nBut I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All\\nthat I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch\\nme and to bless me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!\"\\n  His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed\\nand lighted it as though it were  light of Freedom shining on him.\\n  \"If you hear in my voice- I don\\'t know that it is so, but I hope\\nit is- if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once\\nwas sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you\\ntouch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head\\nthat lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it,\\nweep for it! If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where\\nI will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful\\nservice, I bring back  remembrance of a Home long desolate, while\\nyour poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!\"\\n  She held him closer round  neck, and rocked him on her breast\\nlike a child.\\n  \"If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and\\nthat I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England\\nto he at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life\\nlaid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it,\\nweep for it! And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my\\nfather who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I\\nhave to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having\\nnever for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all\\nnight, because  love of my poor mother hid his torture from me,\\nweep for it, weep for it! Weep for her, then, and for me! Good\\ngentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his\\nsobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank God for us, thank God!\"\\n  He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight\\nso touching, yet so terrible in  tremendous wrong and suffering\\nwhich had gone before it, that  two beholders covered their faces.\\n  When  quiet of  garret had been long undisturbed, and his\\nheaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to  calm that\\nmust follow all storms- emblem to humanity, of  rest and silence\\ninto which  storm called Life must hush at last- they came\\nforward to raise  father and daughter from  ground. He had\\ngradually dropped to  floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out.\\nShe had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm;\\nand her hair drooping over him curtained him from  light.\\n  \"If, without disturbing him,\" she said, raising her hand to Mr.\\nLorry as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose,\\n\"all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from\\n very door, he could be taken away--\"\\n  \"But, consider. Is he fit for  journey?\" asked Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so\\ndreadful to him.\"\\n  \"It is true,\" said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear.\\n\"More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of\\nFrance. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?\"\\n  \"That\\'s business,\" said Mr. Lorry, resuming on  shortest notice\\nhis methodical manners; \"and if business is to be done, I had better\\ndo it.\"\\n  \"Then be so kind,\" urged Miss Manette, \"as to leave us here. You see\\nhow composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with\\nme now. Why should you be? If you will lock  door to secure us from\\ninterruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come\\nback, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of\\nhim until you return, and then we will remove him straight.\"\\n  Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course,\\nand in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only\\ncarriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as\\ntime pressed, for  day was drawing to an end, it came at last to\\ntheir hastily dividing  business that was necessary to be done, and\\nhurrying away to do it.\\n  Then, as  darkness closed in,  daughter laid her head down\\non  hard ground close at  father\\'s side, and watched him. The\\ndarkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light\\ngleamed through  chinks in  wall.\\n  Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for  journey,\\nand had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers,\\nbread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this\\nprovender, and  lamp he carried, on  shoemaker\\'s bench (there\\nwas nothing else in  garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry\\nroused  captive, and assisted him to his feet.\\n  No human intelligence could have read  mysteries of his mind,\\nin  scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had\\nhappened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he\\nknew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have\\nsolved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so\\nvery slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and\\nagreed for  time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost\\nmanner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not\\nbeen seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in  mere sound\\nof his daughter\\'s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.\\n  In  submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion,\\nhe ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on \\ncloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily\\nresponded to his daughter\\'s drawing her arm through his, and took- and\\nkept- her hand in both his own.\\n  They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with  lamp,\\nMr. Lorry closing  little procession. They had not traversed many\\nsteps of  long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at \\nroof and round at  walls.\\n  \"You remember  place, my father? You remember coming up here?\"\\n  \"What did you say?\"\\n  But, before she could repeat  question, he murmured an answer\\nas if she had repeated it.\\n  \"Remember? No, I don\\'t remember. It was so very long ago.\"\\n  That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from\\nhis prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,\\n\"One Hundred and Five, North Tower;\" and when he looked about him,\\nit evidently was for  strong fortress-walls which had long\\nencompassed him. On their reaching  courtyard he instinctively\\naltered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when\\nthere was no drawbridge, and he saw  carriage waiting in  open\\nstreet, he dropped his daughter\\'s hand and clasped his head again.\\n  No crowd was about  door; no people were discernible at any of\\n many windows; not even a chance passer-by was in  street. An\\nunnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be\\nseen, and that was Madame Defarge- who leaned against  door-post,\\nknitting, and saw nothing.\\n  The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed\\nhim, when Mr. Lorry\\'s feet were arrested on  step by his asking,\\nmiserably, for his shoemaking tools and  unfinished shoes. Madame\\nDefarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and\\nwent, knitting, out of  lamplight, through  courtyard. She\\nquickly brought them down and handed them in;- and immediately\\nafterwards leaned against  door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.\\n  Defarge got upon  box, and gave  word \"To  Barrier!\" The\\npostilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under  feeble\\noverswinging lamps.\\n  Under  over-swinging lamps- swinging ever brighter in \\nbetter streets, and ever dimmer in  worse- and by lighted shops,\\ngay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of\\n city gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at  guard-house there.\\n\"Your papers, travellers!\" \"See here then, Monsieur  Officer,\" said\\nDefarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, \"these are \\npapers of monsieur inside, with  white head. They were consigned to\\nme, with him, at --\" He dropped his voice, there was a flutter\\namong  military lanterns, and one of them being handed into \\ncoach by an arm in uniform,  eyes connected with  arm looked,\\nnot an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with  white\\nhead. \"It is well. Forward!\" from  uniform. \"Adieu!\" from\\nDefarge. And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler\\nover-swinging lamps, out under  great grove of stars.\\n  Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote\\nfrom this little earth that  learned tell us it is doubtful whether\\ntheir rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where\\nanything is suffered or done:  shadows of  night were broad\\nand black. All through  cold and restless interval, until dawn,\\nthey once more whispered in  ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry- sitting\\nopposite  buried man who had been dug out, and wondering what\\nsubtle powers were for ever lost to him, and what were capable of\\nrestoration-  old inquiry:\\n  \"I hope you care to be recalled to life?\"\\n  And  old answer:\\n  \"I can\\'t say.\"\\n\\n                  THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.\\n                                BOOK THE SECOND\\n                               THE GOLDEN THREAD\\n  I\\n  FIVE YEARS LATER\\n\\n  TELLSON\\'S BANK by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in \\nyear one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very\\ndark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,\\nmoreover, in  moral attribute that  partners in  House were\\nproud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its\\nugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of\\nits eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express\\nconviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less\\nrespectable. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which\\nthey flashed at more convenient places of business. Tellson\\'s (they\\nsaid) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson\\'s wanted no light, Tellson\\'s\\nwanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.\\'s might, or Snooks Brothers\\'\\nmight; but Tellson\\'s, thank Heaven!--\\n  Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on \\nquestion of rebuilding Tellson\\'s. In this respect  House was much\\non a par with  Country; which did very often disinherit its sons\\nfor suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been\\nhighly objectionable, but were only  more respectable.\\n  Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson\\'s was  triumphant\\nperfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic\\nobstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson\\'s\\ndown two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop,\\nwith two little counters, where  oldest of men made your cheque\\nshake as if  wind rustled it, while they examined  signature\\nby  dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of\\nmud from Fleet-street, and which were made  dingier by their own\\niron bars proper, and  heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business\\nnecessitated your seeing \" House,\" you were put into a species of\\nCondemned Hold at  back, where you meditated on a misspent life,\\nuntil  House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could\\nhardly bunk at it in  dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or\\nwent into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your\\nnose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. Your\\nbank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into\\nrags again. Your plate was stowed away among  neighbouring\\ncesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a\\nday or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of\\nkitchens and sculleries, and fretted all  fat out of their\\nparchments into  banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family\\npapers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great\\ndining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in  year\\none thousand seven hundred and eighty,  first letters written to\\nyou by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly\\nreleased from  horror of being ogled through  windows, by \\nheads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity\\nworthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.\\n  But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in\\nvogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with\\nTellson\\'s. Death is Nature\\'s remedy for all things, and why not\\nLegislation\\'s? Accordingly,  forger was put to Death;  utterer\\nof a bad note was put to Death;  unlawful opener of a letter was\\nput to Death;  purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to\\nDeath;  holder of a horse at Tellson\\'s door, who made off with\\nit, was put to Death;  coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death;\\n sounders of three-fourths of  notes in  whole gamut of\\nCrime, were put to Death. Not that it did  least good in  way of\\nprevention- it might almost have been worth remarking that  fact\\nwas exactly  reverse- but, it cleared off (as to this world) \\ntrouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected\\nwith it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson\\'s, in its day, like\\ngreater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many\\nlives, that, if  heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple\\nBar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have\\nexcluded what little light  ground floor had, in a rather\\nsignificant manner.\\n  Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson\\'s \\noldest of men carried on  business gravely. When they took a\\nyoung man into Tellson\\'s London house, they hid him somewhere till\\nhe was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had\\n full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he\\npermitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and\\ncasting his breeches and gaiters into  general weight of \\nestablishment.\\n  Outside Tellson\\'s- never by any means in it, unless called in- was\\nan odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as\\n live sign of  house. He was never absent during business hours,\\nunless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a\\ngrisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People\\nunderstood that Tellson\\'s, in a stately way, tolerated \\nodd-job-man. The house had always tolerated some person in that\\ncapacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to  post. His\\nsurname was Cruncher, and on  youthful occasion of his renouncing\\nby proxy  works of darkness, in  easterly parish church of\\nHounsditch, he had received  added appellation of Jerry.\\n  The scene was Mr. Cruncher\\'s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,\\nWhitefriars:  time, half-past seven of  clock on a windy March\\nmorning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher\\nhimself always spoke of  year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes:\\napparently under  impression that  Christian era dated from\\n invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name\\nupon it.)\\n  Mr. Cruncher\\'s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and\\nwere but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass\\nin it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early\\nas it was, on  windy March morning,  room in which he lay abed\\nwas already scrubbed throughout; and between  cups and saucers\\narranged for breakfast, and  lumbering deal table, a very clean\\nwhite cloth was spread.\\n  Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin\\nat home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll\\nand surge in bed, until he rose above  surface, with his spiky hair\\nlooking as if it must tear  sheets to ribbons. At which juncture,\\nhe exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:\\n  \"Bust me, if she ain\\'t at it agin!\"\\n  A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in\\na corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was\\n person referred to.\\n  \"What!\" said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. \"You\\'re at\\nit agin, are you?\"\\n  After hailing  morn with this second salutation, he threw a\\nboot at  woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may\\nintroduce  odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher\\'s\\ndomestic economy, that, whereas he often came home after banking hours\\nwith clean boots, he often got up next morning to find  same\\nboots covered with clay.\\n  \"What,\" said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing\\nhis mark- \"what are you up to, Aggerawayter?\"\\n  \"I was only saying my prayers.\"\\n  \"Saying your prayers! You\\'re a nice woman! What do you mean by\\nflopping yourself down and praying agin me?\"\\n  \"I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.\"\\n  \"You weren\\'t. And if you were, I won\\'t be took  liberty with.\\nHere! your mother\\'s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin\\nyour father\\'s prosperity. You\\'ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my\\nson. You\\'ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and\\nflopping herself down, and praying that  bread-and-butter may be\\nsnatched out of  mouth of her only child.\"\\n  Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and,\\nturning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his\\npersonal board.\\n  \"And what do you suppose, you conceited female,\" said Mr.\\nCruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, \"that  worth of your\\nprayers may be? Name  price that you put your prayers at!\"\\n  \"They only come from  heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than\\nthat.\"\\n  \"Worth no more than that,\" repeated Mr. Cruncher. \"They ain\\'t\\nworth much, then. Whether or no, I won\\'t be prayed agin, I tell you. I\\ncan\\'t afford it. I\\'m not a going to be made unlucky by your\\nsneaking. If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of\\nyour husband and child, and not in opposition to \\'em. If I had had any\\nbut a unnat\\'ral wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat\\'ral\\nmother, I might have made some money last week instead of being\\ncounter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumvented into\\n worst of luck. B-u-u-ust me!\" said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time\\nhad been putting on his clothes, \"if I ain\\'t, what with piety and\\none blowed thing and another, been choused this last week into as\\nbad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young\\nJerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye\\nupon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more\\nflopping, give me a call. For, I tell you,\" here he addressed his wife\\nonce more, \"I won\\'t be gone agin, in this manner. I am as rickety as a\\nhackney-coach, I\\'m as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to that\\ndegree that I shouldn\\'t know, if it wasn\\'t for  pain in \\'em,\\nwhich was me and which somebody else, yet I\\'m none  better for it\\nin pocket; and it\\'s my suspicion that you\\'ve been at it from morning\\nto night to prevent me from being  better for it in pocket, and I\\nwon\\'t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say now!\"\\n  Growling, in addition, such phrases as \"Ah! yes! You\\'re religious,\\ntoo. You wouldn\\'t put yourself in opposition to  interests of\\nyour husband and child, would you? Not you!\" and throwing off other\\nsarcastic sparks from  whirling grindstone of his indignation,\\nMr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general\\npreparation for business. In  meantime, his son, whose head was\\ngarnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by\\none another, as his father\\'s did, kept  required watch upon his\\nmother. He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by\\ndarting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a\\nsuppressed cry of \"You are going to flop, mother.- Halloa, father!\"\\nand, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an\\nundutiful grin.\\n  Mr. Cruncher\\'s temper was not at all improved when he came to his\\nbreakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher\\'s saying grace with particular\\nanimosity.\\n  \"Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?\"\\n  His wife explained that she had merely \"asked a blessing.\"\\n  \"Don\\'t do it!\" said Mr. Cruncher, looking about, as if he rather\\nexpected to see  loaf disappear under  efficacy of his wife\\'s\\npetitions. \"I ain\\'t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won\\'t\\nhave my vittles blest off my table. Keep still!\"\\n  Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a\\nparty which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher\\nworried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any\\nfour-footed inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o\\'clock he smoothed\\nhis ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like\\nan exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to\\n occupation of  day.\\n  It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite\\ndescription of himself as \"a honest tradesman.\" His stock consisted of\\na wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which\\nstool, young Jerry, walking at his father\\'s side, carried every\\nmorning to beneath  banking-house window that was nearest Temple\\nBar: where, with  addition of  first handful of straw that could\\nbe gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep  cold and wet from\\n odd-job-man\\'s feet, it formed  encampment for  day. On\\nthis post of his, Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and\\n Temple, as  Bar itself,-and was almost as ill-looking.\\n  Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his\\nthree-cornered hat to  oldest of men as they passed in to\\nTellson\\'s, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with\\nyoung Jerry standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through\\n Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description\\non passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose.\\nFather and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at\\n morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to\\none another as  two eyes of each were, bore a considerable\\nresemblance to a pair of monkeys. The resemblance was not lessened\\nby  accidental circumstance, that  mature Jerry bit and spat out\\nstraw, while  twinkling eyes of  youthful Jerry were as\\nrestlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street.\\n  The head of one of  regular indoor messengers attached to\\nTellson\\'s establishment was put through  door, and  word was\\ngiven:\\n  \"Porter wanted!\"\\n  \"Hooray, father! Here\\'s an early job to begin with!\"\\n  Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself\\non  stool, entered on his reversionary interest in  straw his\\nfather had been chewing, and cogitated.\\n  \"Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!\" muttered young Jerry.\\n\"Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don\\'t get no\\niron rust here!\"\\n  II\\n  A SIGHT\\n\\n  \"YOU KNOW  Old Bailey, well, no doubt?\" said one of  oldest of\\nclerks to Jerry  messenger.\\n  \"Ye-es, sir.\" returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. \"I do\\nknow  Bailey.\"\\n  \"Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.\"\\n  \"I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know  Bailey. Much\\nbetter,\" said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at \\nestablishment in question, \"than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to\\nknow  Bailey.\"\\n  \"Very well. Find  door where  witnesses go in, and show \\ndoor-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.\"\\n  \"Into  court, sir?\"\\n  \"Into  court.\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher\\'s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another,\\nand to interchange  inquiry, \"What do you think of this?\"\\n  \"Am I to wait in  court, sir?\" he asked, as  result of that\\nconference.\\n  \"I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass  note to Mr.\\nLorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry\\'s\\nattention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,\\nto remain there until he wants you.\"\\n  \"Is that all, sir?\"\\n  \"That\\'s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to\\ntell him you are there.\"\\n  As  ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed \\nnote, Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to\\n blotting-paper stage, remarked:\\n  \"I suppose they\\'ll be trying Forgeries this morning?\"\\n  \"Treason!\"\\n  \"That\\'s quartering,\" said Jerry. \"Barbarous!\"\\n  \"It is  law,\" remarked  ancient clerk, turning his surprised\\nspectacles upon him. \"It is  law.\"\\n  \"It\\'s hard in  law to spile a man, I think. It\\'s hard enough to\\nkill him, but it\\'s very hard to spile him, sir.\"\\n  \"Not at all,\" returned  ancient clerk. \"Speak well of  law.\\nTake care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave  law\\nto take care of itself. I give you that advice.\"\\n  \"It\\'s  damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,\" said\\nJerry. \"I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living\\nmine is.\"\\n  \"Well, well,\" said  old clerk; \"we an have our various ways of\\ngaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have\\ndry ways. Here is  letter. Go along.\"\\n  Jerry took  letter, and, remarking to himself with less\\ninternal deference than he made an outward show of, \"You are a lean\\nold one, too,\" made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his\\ndestination, and went his way.\\n  They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so  street outside\\nNewgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since\\nattached to it. But,  gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of\\ndebauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were\\nbred, that came into court with  prisoners, and sometimes rushed\\nstraight from  dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled\\nhim off  bench. It had more than once happened, that  Judge in\\n black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as \\nprisoner\\'s, and even died before him. For  rest,  Old Bailey was\\nfamous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set\\nout continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into \\nother world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and\\nroad, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and\\nso desirable to be good use in  beginning. It was famous, too,\\nfor  pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment\\nof which no one could foresee  extent; also, for  whipping-post,\\nanother dear old institution, very humanising and softening to\\nbehold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money,\\nanother fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to \\nmost frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under\\nHeaven. Altogether,  Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice\\nillustration of  precept, that \"Whatever is is right;\" an\\naphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include\\n troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.\\n  Making his way through  tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this\\nhideous scene of action, with  skill of a man accustomed to make\\nhis way quietly,  messenger found out  door he sought, and\\nhanded in his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to\\nsee  play at  Old Bailey, just as they paid to see  play in\\nBedlam-only  former entertainment was much  dearer. Therefore,\\nall  Old Bailey doors were well guarded- except, indeed,  social\\ndoors by which  criminals got there, and those were always left\\nwide open.\\n  After some delay and demur,  door grudgingly turned on its hinges\\na very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself\\ninto court.\\n  \"What\\'s on?\" he asked, in a whisper, of  man he found himself\\nnext to.\\n  \"Nothing yet.\"\\n  \"What\\'s coming on?\"\\n  \"The Treason case.\"\\n  \"The quartering one, eh?\"\\n  \"Ah!\" returned  man, with a relish; \"he\\'ll be drawn on a hurdle\\nto be half hanged, and then he\\'ll be taken down and sliced before\\nhis own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he\\nlooks on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he\\'ll be cut into\\nquarters. That\\'s  sentence.\"\\n  \"If he\\'s found Guilty, you mean to say?\" Jerry added, by way of\\nproviso.\\n  \"Oh! they\\'ll find him guilty,\" said  other. \"Don\\'t you be\\nafraid of that.\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher\\'s attention was here diverted to  door-keeper,\\nwhom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with  note in his hand.\\nMr. Lorry sat at a table, among  gentlemen in wigs: not far from\\na wigged gentleman,  prisoner\\'s counsel, who had a great bundle\\nof papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman\\nwith his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr.\\nCruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated\\non  ceiling of  court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing\\nof his chin and signing with his hand, Jerry attracted  notice of\\nMr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded\\nand sat down again.\\n  \"What\\'s he got to do with  case?\" asked  man he had spoken\\nwith.\\n  \"Blest if I know,\" said Jerry.\\n  \"What have you got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?\"\\n  \"Blest if I know that either,\" said Jerry.\\n  The entrance of  Judge, and a consequent great stir and\\nsettling down in  court, stopped  dialogue. Presently, \\ndock became  central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been\\nstanding there, went out, and  prisoner was brought in, and put\\nto  bar.\\n  Everybody present, except  one wigged gentleman who looked at \\nceiling, stared at him. All  human breath in  place, rolled at\\nhim, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round\\npillars and comers, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows\\nstood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on  floor of  court,\\nlaid their hands on  shoulders of  people before them, to help\\nthemselves, at anybody\\'s cost, to a view of him- stood a-tiptoe, got\\nupon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.\\nConspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of  spiked\\nwall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at  prisoner  beery\\nbreath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it\\nto mingle with  waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and\\ncoffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon \\ngreat windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.\\n  The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about\\nfive-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek\\nand a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was\\nplainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was\\nlong and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at  back of his neck;\\nmore to be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of  mind\\nwill express itself through any covering of  body, so \\npaleness which his situation engendered came through  brown upon\\nhis cheek, showing  soul to be stronger than  sun. He was\\notherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to  Judge, and stood quiet.\\n  The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,\\nwas not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less\\nhorrible sentence- had there been a chance of any one of its savage\\ndetails being spared- by just so much would he have lost in his\\nfascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully\\nmangled, was  sight;  immortal creature that was to be so\\nbutchered and torn asunder, yielded  sensation. Whatever gloss\\n various spectators put upon  interest, according to their\\nseveral arts and powers of self-deceit,  interest was, at \\nroot of it, Ogreish.\\n  Silence in  court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not\\nGuilty to an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and\\njangle) for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious,\\nexcellent, and so forth, prince, our Lord  King, by reason of his\\nhaving, on divers occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted\\nLewis,  French King, in his wars against our said serene,\\nillustrious, excellent, and so forth; that was to say, by coming and\\ngoing, between  dominions of our said serene, illustrious,\\nexcellent, and so forth, and those of  said French Lewis, and\\nwickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise evil-adverbiously,\\nrevealing to  said French Lewis what forces our said serene,\\nillustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to\\nCanada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head becoming\\nmore and more spiky as  law terms bristled it, made out with huge\\nsatisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at  understanding that\\n aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay,\\nstood there before him upon his trial; that  jury were swearing in;\\nand that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.\\n  The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,\\nbeheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from \\nsituation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and\\nattentive; watched  opening proceedings with a grave interest;\\nand stood with his hands resting on  slab of wood before him, so\\ncomposedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of  herbs with which\\nit was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled\\nwith vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.\\n  Over  prisoner\\'s head there was a mirror, to throw  light down\\nupon him. Crowds of  wicked and  wretched had been reflected\\nin it, and had passed from its surface and this earth\\'s together.\\nHaunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have\\nbeen, if  glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as\\n ocean is one day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of\\n infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have\\nstruck  prisoner\\'s mind. Be that as it may, a change in his\\nposition making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he\\nlooked up; and when he saw  glass his face flushed, and his right\\nhand pushed  herbs away.\\n  It happened, that  action turned his face to that side of \\ncourt which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there\\nsat, in that corner of  Judge\\'s bench, two persons upon whom his\\nlook immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to  changing\\nof his aspect, that all  eyes that were turned upon him, turned\\nto them.\\n  The spectators saw in  two figures, a young lady of little more\\nthan twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of\\na very remarkable appearance in respect of  absolute whiteness of\\nhis hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an\\nactive kind, but pondering and self-communing. When this expression\\nwas upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and\\nbroken up- as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his\\ndaughter- he became a handsome man, not past  prime of life.\\n  His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she\\nsat by him, and  other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him,\\nin her dread of  scene, and in her pity for  prisoner. Her\\nforehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and\\ncompassion that saw nothing but  peril of  accused. This had\\nbeen so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown,\\nthat starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and\\n whisper went about, \"Who are they?\"\\n  Jerry,  messenger, who had made his own observations, in his\\nown manner, and who had been sucking  rust off his fingers in his\\nabsorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd\\nabout him had pressed and passed  inquiry on to  nearest\\nattendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed\\nback; at last it got to Jerry:\\n  \"Witnesses.\"\\n  \"For which side?\"\\n  \"Against.\"\\n  \"Against what side?\"\\n  \"The prisoner\\'s.\"\\n  The Judge, whose eyes had gone in  general direction, recalled\\nthem, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at  man whose\\nlife was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin  rope,\\ngrind  axe, and hammer  nails into  scaffold.\\n  III\\n  A DISAPPOINTMENT\\n\\n  MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL had to inform  jury, that  prisoner\\nbefore them, though young in years, was old in  treasonable\\npractices which claimed  forfeit of his life. That this\\ncorrespondence with  public enemy was not a correspondence of\\nto-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of  year\\nbefore. That, it was certain  prisoner had, for longer than that,\\nbeen in  habit of passing and repassing between France and England,\\non secret business of which he could give no honest account. That,\\nif it were in  nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily\\nit never was),  real wickedness and guilt of his business might\\nhave remained undiscovered. That Providence, however, had put it\\ninto  heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to\\nferret out  nature of  prisoner\\'s schemes, and, struck with\\nhorror, to disclose them to his Majesty\\'s Chief Secretary of State and\\nmost honourable Privy Council. That, this patriot would be produced\\nbefore them. That, his position and attitude were, on  whole,\\nsublime. That, he had been  prisoner\\'s friend, but, at once in an\\nauspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to\\nimmolate  traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on \\nsacred altar of his country. That, if statues were decreed in Britain,\\nas in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining\\ncitizen would assuredly have had one. That, as they were not so\\ndecreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue, as had been\\nobserved by  poets (in many passages which he well knew  jury\\nwould have, word for word, at  tips of their tongues; whereat \\njury\\'s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew\\nnothing about  passages), was in a manner contagious; more\\nespecially  bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of\\ncountry. That,  lofty example of this immaculate and\\nunimpeachable witness for  Crown, to refer to whom however\\nunworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to  prisoner\\'s\\nservant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his\\nmaster\\'s table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. That, he\\n(Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement\\nattempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he\\npreferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General\\'s) brothers and sisters,\\nand honoured him more than his (Mr. Attorney-General\\'s) father and\\nmother. That, he called with confidence on  jury to come and do\\nlikewise. That,  evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with\\n documents of their discovering that would be produced, would\\nshow  prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty\\'s\\nforces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and\\nland, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such\\ninformation to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be\\nproved to be in  prisoner\\'s handwriting; but that it was all \\nsame; that, indeed, it was rather  better for  prosecution, as\\nshowing  prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, \\nproof would go back five years, and would show  prisoner already\\nengaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before \\ndate of  very first action fought between  British troops and\\n Americans. That, for these reasons,  jury, being a loyal jury\\n(as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as they knew\\nthey were), must positively find  prisoner Guilty, and make an\\nend of him, whether they liked it or not. That, they never could lay\\ntheir heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate \\nidea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that,\\nthey never could endure  notion of their children laying their\\nheads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be,\\nfor them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless\\n prisoner\\'s head was taken off. That head Mr. Attorney-General\\nconcluded by demanding of them, in  name of everything he could\\nthink of with a round turn in it, and on  faith of his solemn\\nasseveration that he already considered  prisoner as good as dead\\nand gone.\\n  When  Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in  court as if\\na cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about  prisoner, in\\nanticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, \\nunimpeachable patriot appeared in  witness-box.\\n  Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader\\'s lead, examined\\n patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure\\nsoul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be-\\nperhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released\\nhis noble bosom of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn\\nhimself, but that  wigged gentleman with  papers before him,\\nsitting not far from Mr. Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The\\nwigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at  ceiling of \\ncourt.\\n  Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned  base insinuation.\\nWhat did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn\\'t\\nprecisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of\\nanybody\\'s. Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant\\nrelation. Very distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not.\\nNever in a debtors\\' prison? Didn\\'t see what that had to do with it.\\nNever in a debtors\\' prison?- Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many\\ntimes? Two or three times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what\\nprofession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been.\\nFrequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs? Decidedly not; once received a\\nkick on  top of a staircase, and fell down-stairs of his own\\naccord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to\\nthat effect was said by  intoxicated liar who committed \\nassault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true? Positively.\\nEver live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not more than\\nother gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of  prisoner? Yes. Ever pay\\nhim? No. Was not this intimacy with  prisoner, in reality a very\\nslight one, forced upon  prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?\\nNo. Sure he saw  prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more\\nabout  lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance?\\nNo. Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular\\ngovernment pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do\\nanything? Oh dear no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives\\nbut motives of sheer patriotism? None whatever.\\n  The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through  case at a\\ngreat rate. He had taken service with  prisoner, in good faith\\nand simplicity, four years ago. He had asked  prisoner, aboard\\n Calais packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and  prisoner had\\nengaged him. He had not asked  prisoner to take  handy fellow as\\nan act of charity- never thought of such a thing. He began to have\\nsuspicions of  prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon\\nafterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen\\nsimilar lists to these in  prisoner\\'s pockets, over and over again.\\nHe had taken these lists from  drawer of  prisoner\\'s desk. He\\nhad not put them there first. He had seen  prisoner show these\\nidentical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to\\nFrench gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne. He loved his country,\\nand couldn\\'t bear it, and had given information. He had never been\\nsuspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned\\nrespecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one.\\nHe had known  last witness seven or eight years; that was merely\\na coincidence. He didn\\'t call it a particularly curious coincidence;\\nmost coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a curious\\ncoincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. He was a\\ntrue Briton, and hoped there were many like him.\\n  The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr.\\nJarvis Lorry.\\n  \"Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson\\'s bank?\"\\n  \"I am.\"\\n  \"On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred\\nand seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London\\nand Dover by  mail?\"\\n  \"It did.\"\\n  \"Were there any other passengers in  mail?\"\\n  \"Two.\"\\n  \"Did they alight on  road in  course of  night?\"\\n  \"They did.\"\\n  \"Mr. Lorry, look upon  prisoner. Was he one of those two\\npassengers?\"\\n  \"I cannot undertake to say that he was.\"\\n  \"Does he resemble either of these two passengers?\"\\n  \"Both were so wrapped up, and  night was so dark, and we were all\\nso reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.\"\\n  \"Mr. Lorry, look again upon  prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up\\nas those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and\\nstature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  \"You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  \"So at least you say he may have been one of them?\"\\n  \"Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been- like myself\\n-timorous of highwaymen, and  prisoner has not a timorous air.\"\\n  \"Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?\"\\n  \"I certainly have seen that.\"\\n  \"Mr. Lorry, look once more upon  prisoner. Have you seen him,\\nto your certain knowledge, before?\"\\n  \"I have.\"\\n  \"When?\"\\n  \"I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at\\nCalais,  prisoner came on board  packet-ship in which I\\nreturned, and made  voyage with me.\"\\n  \"At what hour did he come on board?\"\\n  \"At a little after midnight.\"\\n  \"In  dead of  night. Was he  only passenger who came on\\nboard at that untimely hour?\"\\n  \"He happened to be  only one.\"\\n  \"Never mind about \\'happening,\\' Mr. Lorry. He was  only\\npassenger who came on board in  dead of  night?\"\\n  \"He was.\"\\n  \"Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?\"\\n  \"With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.\"\\n  \"They are here. Had you any conversation with  prisoner?\"\\n  \"Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and  passage long and rough,\\nand I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.\"\\n  \"Miss Manette!\"\\n  The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were\\nnow turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with\\nher, and kept her hand drawn through his arm.\\n  \"Miss Manette, look upon  prisoner.\"\\n  To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and\\nbeauty, was far more trying to  accused than to be confronted\\nwith all  crowd. Standing, as it were, apart with her on  edge\\nof his grave, not all  staring curiosity that looked on, could, for\\n moment, nerve him to remain quite still. His hurried right hand\\nparcelled out  herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a\\ngarden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook\\n lips from which  colour rushed to his heart. The buzz of \\ngreat flies was loud again.\\n  \"Miss Manette, have you seen  prisoner before?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"Where?\"\\n  \"On board of  packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on \\nsame occasion.\"\\n  \"You are  young lady just now referred to?\"\\n  \"O! most unhappily, I am!\"\\n  The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into  less musical\\nvoice of  Judge, as he said something fiercely: \"Answer \\nquestions put to you, and make no remark upon them.\"\\n  \"Miss Manette, had you any conversation with  prisoner on that\\npassage across  Channel?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"Recall it.\"\\n  In  midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began:\\n  \"When  gentleman came on board--\"\\n  \"Do you mean  prisoner?\" inquired  Judge, knitting his brows.\\n  \"Yes, my Lord.\"\\n  \"Then say  prisoner.\"\\n  \"When  prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,\"\\nturning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, \"was much\\nfatigued and in a very weak state of health. My father was so\\nreduced that I was afraid to take him out of  air, and I had made a\\nbed for him on  deck near  cabin steps, and I sat on  deck at\\nhis side to take care of him. There were no other passengers that\\nnight, but we four. The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to\\nadvise me how I could shelter my father from  wind and weather,\\nbetter than I had done. I had not known how to do it well, not\\nunderstanding how  wind would set when we were out of \\nharbour. He did it for me. He expressed great gentleness and\\nkindness for my father\\'s state, and I am sure he felt it. That was \\nmanner of our beginning to speak together.\"\\n  \"Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  \"How many were with him?\"\\n  \"Two French gentlemen.\"\\n  \"Had they conferred together?\"\\n  \"They had conferred together until  last moment, when it was\\nnecessary for  French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.\"\\n  \"Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these\\nlists?\"\\n  \"Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don\\'t know what\\npapers.\"\\n  \"Like these in shape and size?\"\\n  \"Possibly, but indeed I don\\'t know, although they stood whispering\\nvery near to me: because they stood at  top of  cabin steps to\\nhave  light of  lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp,\\nand they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw\\nonly that they looked at papers.\"\\n  \"Now, to  prisoner\\'s conversation, Miss Manette.\"\\n  \"The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me- which arose out\\nof my helpless situation- as he was kind, and good, and useful to my\\nfather. I hope,\" bursting into tears, \"I may not repay him by doing\\nhim harm to-day.\"\\n  Buzzing from  blue-flies.\\n  \"Miss Manette, if  prisoner does not perfectly understand that\\nyou give  evidence which it is your duty to give- which you must\\ngive- and which you cannot escape from giving- with great\\nunwillingness, he is  only person present in that condition. Please\\nto go on.\"\\n  \"He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and\\ndifficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was\\ntherefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business\\nhad, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at\\nintervals, take him backwards and forwards between France and\\nEngland for a long time to come.\"\\n  \"Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.\"\\n  \"He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he\\nsaid that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on\\nEngland\\'s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George\\nWashington might gain almost as great a name in history as George\\n Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was\\nsaid laughingly, and to beguile  time.\"\\n  Any strongly marked expression of face on  part of a chief\\nactor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed,\\nwill be unconsciously imitated by  spectators. Her forehead was\\npainfully anxious and instent as she gave this evidence, and, in \\npauses when she stopped for  Judge to write it down, watched its\\neffect upon  counsel for and against. Among  lookers-on there\\nwas  same expression in all quarters of  court; insomuch, that a\\ngreat majority of  foreheads there, might have been mirrors\\nreflecting  witness, when  Judge looked up from his notes to\\nglare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.\\n  Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it\\nnecessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call  young\\nlady\\'s father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.\\n  \"Doctor Manette, look upon  prisoner. Have you ever seen him\\nbefore?\"\\n  \"Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or\\nthree years and a half ago.\"\\n  \"Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board \\npacket, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?\"\\n  \"Sir, I can do neither.\"\\n  \"Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to\\ndo either?\"\\n  He answered, in a low voice, \"There is.\"\\n  \"Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without\\ntrial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?\"\\n  He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, \"A long\\nimprisonment.\"\\n  \"Were you newly released on  occasion in question?\"\\n  \"They tell me so.\"\\n  \"Have you no remembrance of  occasion?\"\\n  \"None. My mind is a blank, from some time- I cannot even say what\\ntime- when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to \\ntime when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter\\nhere. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my\\nfaculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become\\nfamiliar. I have no remembrance of  process.\"\\n  Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and  father and daughter sat\\ndown together.\\n  A singular circumstance then arose in  case. The object in hand\\nbeing to show that  prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter\\nuntracked, in  Dover mail on that Friday night in November five\\nyears ago, and got out of  mail in  night, as a blind, at a\\nplace where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some\\ndozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected\\ninformation; a witness was called to identify him as having been at\\n precise time required, in  coffee-room of an hotel in that\\ngarrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person. The prisoner\\'s\\ncounsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that\\nhe had never seen  prisoner on any other occasion, when \\nwigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at  ceiling\\nof  court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper,\\nscrewed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening this piece of paper in\\n next pause,  counsel looked with great attention and\\ncuriosity at  prisoner.\\n  \"You say again you are quite sure that it was  prisoner?\"\\n  The witness was quite sure.\\n  \"Did you ever see anybody very like  prisoner?\"\\n  Not so like ( witness said) as that he could be mistaken.\\n  \"Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,\" pointing\\nto him who had tossed  paper over, \"and then look well upon \\nprisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?\"\\n  Allowing for my learned friend\\'s appearance being careless and\\nslovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to\\nsurprise, not only  witness, but everybody present, when they\\nwere thus brought into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my\\nlearned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent,\\n likeness became much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr.\\nStryver ( prisoner\\'s counsel), whether they were next to try Mr.\\nCarton (name of my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver\\nreplied to my Lord, no; but he would ask  witness to tell him\\nwhether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would\\nhave been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his\\nrashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and\\nmore. The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a\\ncrockery vessel, and shiver his part of  case to useless lumber.\\n  Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his\\nfingers in his following of  evidence. He had now to attend while\\nMr. Stryver fitted  prisoner\\'s case on  jury, like a compact\\nsuit of clothes; showing them how  patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy\\nand traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of \\ngreatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas- which he\\ncertainly did look rather like. How  virtuous servant, Cly, was his\\nfriend and partner, and was worthy to be; how  watchful eyes of\\nthose forgers and false swearers had rested on  prisoner as a\\nvictim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French\\nextraction, did require his making those passages across \\nChannel- though what those affairs were, a consideration for others\\nwho were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to\\ndisclose. How  evidence that had been warped and wrested from \\nyoung lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to\\nnothing, involving  mere little innocent gallantries and\\npolitenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady\\nso thrown together;- with  exception of that reference to George\\nWashington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to\\nbe regarded in any other fight than as a monstrous joke. How it\\nwould be a weakness in  government to break down in this attempt to\\npractise for popularity on  lowest national antipathies and\\nfears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made  most of it;\\nhow, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous\\ncharacter of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which\\n State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord\\ninterposed (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying\\nthat he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.\\n  Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next\\nto attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned  whole suit of\\nclothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on  jury, inside out; showing how\\nBarsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought\\nthem, and  prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord\\nhimself, turning  suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside\\nin, but on  whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into\\ngrave-clothes for  prisoner.\\n  And now,  jury turned to consider, and  great flies swarmed\\nagain.\\n  Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at  ceiling of  court,\\nchanged neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.\\nWhile his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before\\nhim, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time\\nglanced anxiously at  jury; while all  spectators moved more\\nor less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose\\nfrom his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform, not\\nunattended by a suspicion in  minds of  audience that his\\nstate was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his torn\\ngown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to\\nlight on his head after its removal, his hands in his pockets, and his\\neyes on  ceiling as they had been all day. Something especially\\nreckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look,\\nbut so diminished  strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to \\nprisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared\\ntogether, had strengthened), that many of  lookers-on, taking\\nnote of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought\\n two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made  observation to his next\\nneighbour, and added, \"I\\'d hold half a guinea that he don\\'t get no\\nlaw-work to do. Don\\'t look like  sort of one to get any, do he?\"\\n  Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of  details of  scene than\\nhe appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette\\'s head dropped upon\\nher father\\'s breast, he was  first to see it, and to say audibly:\\n\"Officer! look to that young lady. Help  gentleman to take her out.\\nDon\\'t you see she will fall!\"\\n  There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much\\nsympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to\\nhim, to have  days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown\\nstrong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering\\nor brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy\\ncloud, ever since. As he passed out,  jury, who had turned back and\\npaused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.\\n  They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with\\nGeorge Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not\\nagreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch\\nand ward, and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and \\nlamps in  court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured\\nthat  jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to\\nget refreshment, and  prisoner withdrew to  back of  dock,\\nand sat down.\\n  Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when  young lady and her father\\nwent out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in  slackened\\ninterest, could easily get near him.\\n  \"Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep\\nin  way. You will be sure to hear when  jury come in. Don\\'t be a\\nmoment behind them, for I want you to take  verdict back to \\nbank. You are  quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple\\nBar long before I can.\"\\n  Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in\\nacknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came\\nup at  moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on  arm.\\n  \"How is  young lady?\"\\n  \"She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and\\nshe feels  better for being out of court.\"\\n  \"I\\'ll tell  prisoner so. It won\\'t do for a respectable bank\\ngentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated \\npoint in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to  outside of \\nbar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed\\nhim, all eyes, ears, and spikes.\\n  \"Mr. Darnay!\"\\n  The prisoner came forward directly.\\n  \"You will naturally be anxious to hear of  witness, Miss Manette.\\nShe will do very well. You have seen  worst of her agitation.\"\\n  \"I am deeply sorry to have been  cause of it. Could you tell\\nher so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?\"\\n  \"Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.\"\\n  Mr. Carton\\'s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He\\nstood, half turned from  prisoner, lounging with his elbow\\nagainst  bar.\\n  \"I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.\"\\n  \"What,\" said Carton, still only half turned towards him, \"do you\\nexpect, Mr. Darnay?\"\\n  \"The worst.\"\\n  \"It\\'s  wisest thing to expect, and  likeliest. But I think\\ntheir withdrawing is in your favour.\"\\n  Loitering on  way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard\\nno more: but left them- so like each other in feature, so unlike\\neach other in manner- standing side by side, both reflected in \\nglass above them.\\n  An hour and a half limped heavily away in  thief-and-rascal\\ncrowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies\\nand ale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after\\ntaking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and\\na rapid tide of people setting up  stairs that led to  court,\\ncarried him along with them.\\n  \"Jerry! Jerry!\" Mr. Lorry was already calling at  door when he\\ngot there.\\n  \"Here, sir! It\\'s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!\"\\n  Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through  throng. \"Quick! Have you\\ngot it?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  Hastily written on  paper was  word \"AQUITTED.\"\\n  \"If you had sent  message, \\'Recalled to Life,\\' again,\" muttered\\nJerry, as he turned, \"I should have known what you meant, this time.\"\\n  He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything\\nelse, until he was clear of  Old Bailey; for,  crowd came\\npouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and\\na loud buzz swept into  street as if  baffled blue-flies were\\ndispersing in search of other carrion.\\n  IV\\n  CONGRATULATORY\\n\\n  FROM  dimly-lighted passages of  court,  last sediment of\\n human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off,\\nwhen Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, \\nsolicitor for  defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood\\ngathered round Mr. Charles Darnay- just released- congratulating him\\non his escape from death.\\n  It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise\\nin Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, \\nshoemaker of  garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him\\ntwice, without looking again: even though  opportunity of\\nobservation had not extended to  mournful cadence of his low\\ngrave voice, and to  abstraction that overclouded him fitfully,\\nwithout any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a\\nreference to his long lingering agony, would always- as on \\ntrial- evoke this condition from  depths of his soul, it was also\\nin its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as\\nincomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had\\nseen  shadow of  actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer\\nsun, when  substance was three hundred miles away.\\n  Only his daughter had  power of charming this black brooding from\\nhis mind. She was  golden thread that united him to a Past beyond\\nhis misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and  sound of her\\nvoice,  light of her face,  touch of her hand, had a strong\\nbeneficial influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always,\\nfor she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but\\nthey were few and slight, and she believed them over.\\n  Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had\\nturned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of\\nlittle more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was,\\nstout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a\\npushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into\\ncompanies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering\\nhis way up in life.\\n  He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at\\nhis late client to that degree that he squeezed  innocent Mr. Lorry\\nclean out of  group: \"I am glad to have brought you off with\\nhonour, Mr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly\\ninfamous; but not  less likely to succeed on that account.\"\\n  \"You have laid me under an obligation to you for life- in two\\nsenses,\" said his late client, taking his hand.\\n  \"I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good\\nas another man\\'s, I believe.\"\\n  It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, \"Much better,\" Mr.\\nLorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with \\ninterested object of squeezing himself back again.\\n  \"You think so?\" said Mr. Stryver. \"Well! you have been present all\\nday, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.\"\\n  \"And as such,\" quoth Mr. Lorry, whom  counsel learned in \\nlaw had now shouldered back into  group, just as he had\\npreviously shouldered him out of it- \"as such I will appeal to\\nDoctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our\\nhomes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are\\nworn out.\"\\n  \"Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\" said Stryver; \"I have a night\\'s\\nwork to do yet. Speak for yourself.\"\\n  \"I speak for myself,\" answered Mr. Lorry, \"and for Mr. Darnay, and\\nfor Miss Lucie, and- Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us\\nall?\" He asked her  question pointedly, and with a glance at her\\nfather.\\n  His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at\\nDarnay; an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and\\ndistrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression\\non him his thoughts had wandered away.\\n  \"My father,\" said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.\\n  He slowly shook  shadow off, and turned to her.\\n  \"Shall we go home, my father?\"\\n  With a long breath, he answered \"Yes.\"\\n  The friends of  acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under \\nimpression- which he himself had originated- that he would not be\\nreleased that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in \\npassages,  iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,\\nand  dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning\\'s interest\\nof gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople\\nit. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed\\ninto  open air. A hackney-coach was called, and  father and\\ndaughter departed in it.\\n  Mr. Stryver had left them in  passages, to shoulder his way\\nback to  robing-room. Another person, who had not joined  group,\\nor interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been\\nleaning against  wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently\\nstrolled out after  rest, and had looked on until  coach drove\\naway. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon\\n pavement.\\n  \"So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\"\\n  Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton\\'s part in  day\\'s\\nproceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none\\n better for it in appearance.\\n  \"If you knew what a conflict goes on in  business mind, when\\n business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business\\nappearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, \"You have mentioned that\\nbefore, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own\\nmasters. We have to think of  House more than ourselves.\"\\n  \"I know, I know,\" rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. \"Don\\'t be\\nnettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt:\\nbetter, I dare say.\"\\n  \"And indeed, sir,\" pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, \"I really\\ndon\\'t know what you have to do with  matter. If you\\'ll excuse me,\\nas very much your elder, for saying so, I really don\\'t know that it is\\nyour business.\"\\n  \"Business! Bless you, I have no business,\" said Mr. Carton.\\n  \"It is a pity you have not, sir.\"\\n  \"I think so, too.\"\\n  \"If you had,\" pursued Mr. Lorry, \"perhaps you would attend to it.\"\\n  \"Lord love you, no!- I shouldn\\'t,\" said Mr. Carton.\\n  \"Well, sir!\" cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,\\n\"business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And,\\nsir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and\\nimpediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how\\nto make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God\\nbless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a\\nprosperous and happy life.- Chair there!\"\\n  Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well  barrister, Mr.\\nLorry bustled into  chair, and was carried off to Tellson\\'s.\\nCarton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite\\nsober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay:\\n  \"This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must\\nbe a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart\\non these street stones?\"\\n  \"I hardly seem yet,\" returned Charles Darnay, \"to belong to this\\nworld again.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t wonder at it; it\\'s not so long since you were pretty far\\nadvanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.\"\\n  \"I begin to think I am faint.\"\\n  \"Then why  devil don\\'t you dine? I dined, myself, while those\\nnumskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to- this, or\\nsome other. Let me show you  nearest tavern to dine well at.\"\\n  Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to\\nFleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were\\nshown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his\\nstrength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat\\nopposite to him at  same table, with his separate bottle of port\\nbefore him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.\\n  \"Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again,\\nMr. Darnay?\"\\n  \"I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far\\nmended as to feel that.\"\\n  \"It must be an immense satisfaction!\"\\n  He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a\\nlarge one.\\n  \"As to me,  greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to\\nit. It bas no good in it for me- except wine like this- nor I for\\nit. So we are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to\\nthink we are not much alike in any particular, you and I.\"\\n  Confused by  emotion of  day, and feeling his being there with\\nthis Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay\\nwas at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.\\n  \"Now your dinner is done,\" Carton presently said, \"why don\\'t you\\ncall a health, Mr. Darnay; why don\\'t you give your toast?\"\\n  \"What health? What toast?\"\\n  \"Why, it\\'s on  tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be,\\nI\\'ll swear it\\'s there.\"\\n  \"Miss Manette, then!\"\\n  \"Miss Manette, then!\"\\n  Looking his companion full in  face while he drank  toast,\\nCarton flung his glass over his shoulder against  wall, where it\\nshivered to pieces; then, rang  bell, and ordered in another.\\n  \"That\\'s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in  dark, Mr.\\nDarnay!\" he said, filling his new goblet.\\n  A slight frown and a laconic \"Yes,\" were  answer.\\n  \"That\\'s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How\\ndoes it feel? Is it worth being tried for one\\'s life, to be  object\\nof such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\"\\n  Again Darnay answered not a word.\\n  \"She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it\\nher. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\"\\n  The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this\\ndisagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in\\n strait of  day. He turned  dialogue to that point, and\\nthanked him for it.\\n  \"I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\" was  careless\\nrejoinder. \"It was nothing to do, in  first place; and I don\\'t know\\nwhy I did it, in  second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\"\\n  \"Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.\"\\n  \"Do you think I particularly like you?\"\\n  \"Really, Mr. Carton,\" returned  other, oddly disconcerted, \"I\\nhave not asked myself  question.\"\\n  \"But ask yourself  question now.\"\\n  \"You have acted as if you do; but I don\\'t think you do.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t think I do,\" said Carton. \"I begin to have a very good\\nopinion of your understanding.\"\\n  \"Nevertheless,\" pursued Darnay, rising to ring  bell, \"there is\\nnothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling  reckoning, and\\nour parting without ill-blood on either side.\"\\n  Carton rejoining, \"Nothing in life!\" Darnay rang. \"Do you call \\nwhole reckoning?\" said Carton. On his answering in  affirmative,\\n\"Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and\\nwake me at ten.\"\\n  The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good\\nnight. Without returning  wish, Carton rose too, with something\\nof a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, \"A last word, Mr.\\nDarnay: you think I am drunk?\"\\n  \"I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\"\\n  \"Think? You know I have been drinking.\"\\n  \"Since I must say so, I know it.\"\\n  \"Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge,\\nsir. I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.\"\\n  \"Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.\"\\n  \"May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don\\'t let your sober face\\nelate you, however; you don\\'t know what it may come to. Good night!\"\\n  When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to\\na glass that hung against  wall, and surveyed himself minutely in\\nit.\\n  \"Do you particularly like  man?\" he muttered, at his own image;\\n\"why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is\\nnothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change\\nyou have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that\\nhe shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have\\nbeen! Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by\\nthose blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as\\nhe was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate  fellow.\"\\n  He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a\\nfew minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling\\nover  table, and a long winding-sheet in  candle dripping down\\nupon him.\\n  V\\n  THE JACKAL\\n\\n  THOSE WERE drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great\\nis  improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a\\nmoderate statement of  quantity of wine and punch which one man\\nwould swallow in  course of a night, without any detriment to his\\nreputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a\\nridiculous exaggeration. The learned profession of  law was\\ncertainly not behind any other learned profession in its\\nBacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast\\nshouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his\\ncompeers in this particular, any more than in  drier parts of \\nlegal race.\\n  A favourite at  Old Bailey, and eke at  Sessions, Mr.\\nStryver had begun cautiously to hew away  lower staves of \\nladder on which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to\\nsummon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and\\nshouldering itself towards  visage of  Lord Chief Justice in \\nCourt of King\\'s Bench,  florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might\\nbe daily seen, bursting out of  bed of wigs, like a great sunflower\\npushing its way at  sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring\\ncompanions.\\n  It had once been noted at  Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib\\nman, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that\\nfaculty of extracting  essence from a heap of statements, which\\nis among  most striking and necessary of  advocate\\'s\\naccomplishments. But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to\\nthis. The more business he got,  greater his power seemed to grow\\nof getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat\\ncarousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers\\'\\nends in  morning.\\n  Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver\\'s\\ngreat ally. What  two drank together, between Hilary Term and\\nMichaelmas, might have floated a king\\'s ship. Stryver never had a case\\nin hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his\\npockets, staring at  ceiling of  court; they went  same\\nCircuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into\\n night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home\\nstealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At\\nlast, it began to get about, among such as were interested in \\nmatter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an\\namazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to\\nStryver in that humble capacity.\\n  \"Ten o\\'clock, sir,\" said  man at  tavern, whom he had\\ncharged to wake him- \"ten o\\'clock, sir.\"\\n  \"What\\'s  matter?\"\\n  \"Ten o\\'clock, sir.\"\\n  \"What do you mean? Ten o\\'clock at night?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.\"\\n  \"Oh! I remember. Very well, very well.\"\\n  After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which  man\\ndexterously combated by stirring  fire continuously for five\\nminutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned\\ninto  Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing \\npavements of King\\'s Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into \\nStryver chambers.\\n  The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone\\nhome, and  Stryver principal opened  door. He had his slippers\\non, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater\\nease. He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about \\neyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from\\n portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under\\nvarious disguises of Art, through  portraits of every Drinking Age.\\n  \"You are a little late, Memory,\" said Stryver.\\n  \"About  usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.\"\\n  They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with\\npapers, where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon  hob,\\nand in  midst of  wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty\\nof wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.\\n  \"You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.\"\\n  \"Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with  day\\'s client; or\\nseeing him dine- it\\'s all one!\"\\n  \"That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon \\nidentification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?\"\\n  \"I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should\\nhave been much  same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.\"\\n  Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.\\n  \"You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.\"\\n  Sullenly enough,  jackal loosened his dress, went into an\\nadjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin,\\nand a towel or two. Steeping  towels in  water, and partially\\nwringing them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to\\nbehold, sat down at  table, and said, \"Now I am ready!\"\\n  \"Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,\" said Mr.\\nStryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.\\n  \"How much?\"\\n  \"Only two sets of them.\"\\n  \"Give me  worst first.\"\\n  \"There they are, Sydney. Fire away!\"\\n  The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side\\nof  drinking-table, while  jackal sat at his own\\npaper-bestrewn table proper, on  other side of it, with  bottles\\nand glasses ready to his hand. Both resorted to  drinking-table\\nwithout stint, but each in a different way;  lion for  most part\\nreclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at  fire, or\\noccasionally flirting with some lighter document;  jackal, with\\nknitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes\\ndid not even follow  hand he stretched out for his glass- which\\noften groped about, for a minute or more, before it found  glass\\nfor his lips. Two or three times,  matter in hand became so knotty,\\nthat  jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his\\ntowels anew. From these pilgrimages to  jug and basin, he\\nreturned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can\\ndescribe; which were made  more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.\\n  At length  jackal had got together a compact repast for  lion,\\nand proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and\\ncaution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and \\njackal assisted both. When  repast was fully discussed,  lion\\nput his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to mediate. The\\njackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and\\na fresh application to his head, and applied himself to  collection\\nof a second meal; this was administered to  lion in  same\\nmanner, and was not disposed of until  clocks struck three in \\nmorning.\\n  \"And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,\" said Mr.\\nStryver.\\n  The jackal removed  towels from his head, which had been steaming\\nagain, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.\\n  \"You were very sound, Sydney, in  matter of those crown witnesses\\nto-day. Every question told.\"\\n  \"I always am sound; am I not?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some\\npunch to it and smooth it again.\"\\n  With a deprecatory grunt,  jackal again complied.\\n  \"The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,\" said Stryver,\\nnodding his head over him as he reviewed him in  present and \\npast, \" old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down  next; now\\nin spirits and now in despondency!\"\\n  \"Ah!\" returned  other, sighing: \"yes! The same Sydney, with \\nsame luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did\\nmy own.\"\\n  \"And why not?\"\\n  \"God knows. It was my way, I suppose.\"\\n  He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out\\nbefore him, looking at  fire.\\n  \"Carton,\" said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying\\nair, as if  fire-grate had been  furnace in which sustained\\nendeavour was forged, and  one delicate thing to be done for \\nold Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into\\nit, \"your way is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and\\npurpose. Look at me.\"\\n  \"Oh, botheration!\" returned Sydney, with a lighter and more\\ngood-humoured laugh, \"don\\'t you be moral!\"\\n  \"How have I done what I have done?\" said Stryver; \"how do I do\\nwhat I do?\"\\n  \"Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it\\'s not worth\\nyour while to apostrophise me, or  air, about it; what you want\\nto do, you do. You were always in  front rank, and I was always\\nbehind.\"\\n  \"I had to get into  front rank; I was not born there, was I?\"\\n  \"I was not present at  ceremony; but my opinion is you were,\"\\nsaid Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.\\n  \"Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,\"\\npursued Carton, \"you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen\\ninto mine. Even when we were fellow-students in  Student-Quarter of\\nParis, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that\\nwe didn\\'t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was\\nalways- nowhere.\"\\n  \"And whose fault was that?\"\\n  \"Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were\\nalways driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that\\nrestless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and\\nrepose. It\\'s a gloomy thing, however, to talk about one\\'s own past,\\nwith  day breaking. Turn me in some other direction before I go.\"\\n  \"Well then! Pledge me to  pretty witness,\" said Stryver,\\nholding up his glass. \"Are you turned in a pleasant direction?\"\\n  Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.\\n  \"Pretty witness,\" he muttered, looking down into his glass. \"I\\nhave had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who\\'s your pretty\\nwitness?\"\\n  \"The picturesque doctor\\'s daughter, Miss Manette.\"\\n  \"She pretty?\"\\n  \"Is she not?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  \"Why, man alive, she was  admiration of  whole Court!\"\\n  \"Rot  admiration of  whole Court! Who made  Old Bailey a\\njudge of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!\"\\n  \"Do you know, Sydney,\" said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp\\neyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: \"do you\\nknow, I rather thought, at  time, that you sympathised with \\ngolden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to \\ngolden-haired doll?\"\\n  \"Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons\\nwithin a yard or two of a man\\'s nose, he can see it without a\\nperspective-glass. I pledge you, but I deny  beauty. And now I\\'ll\\nhave no more drink; I\\'ll get to bed.\"\\n  When his host followed him out on  staircase with a candle, to\\nlight him down  stairs,  day was coldly looking in through its\\ngrimy windows. When he got out of  house,  air was cold and sad,\\n dull sky overcast,  river dark and dim,  whole scene like\\na lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round\\nbefore  morning blast, as if  desert-sand had risen far away,\\nand  first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm \\ncity.\\n  Waste forces within him. and a desert all around, this man stood\\nstill on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment,\\nlying in  wilderness before him, a mirage honourable ambition,\\nself-denial, and perseverance. In  fair city of this vision,\\nthere were airy galleries from which  loves and graces looked\\nupon him, gardens in which  fruits of life hung ripening, waters of\\nHope that sparkled in his sight. A moment, and it was gone. Climbing\\nto a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his\\nclothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.\\n  Sadly, sadly,  sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than \\nman of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed\\nexercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of\\n blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.\\n  VI\\n  HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE\\n\\n  THE QUIET LODGINGS of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner\\nnot far from Soho-square. On  afternoon of a certain fine Sunday\\nwhen  waves of four months had rolled over  trial for treason,\\nand carried it, as to  public interest and memory, far out to\\nsea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along  sunny streets from\\nClerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with  Doctor.\\nAfter several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had\\nbecome  Doctor\\'s friend, and  quiet street-corner was \\nsunny part of his life.\\n  On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in\\n afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine\\nSundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with  Doctor and\\nLucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed\\nto be with them as  family friend, talking, reading, looking out of\\nwindow, and generally getting through  day; thirdly, because be\\nhappened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how\\n ways of  Doctor\\'s household pointed to that time as a likely\\ntime for solving them.\\n  A quainter corner than  corner where  Doctor lived, was not to\\nbe found in London. There was no way through it, and  front windows\\nof  Doctor\\'s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street\\nthat had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings\\nthen, north of  Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and\\nwild flowers grew, and  hawthorn blossomed, in  now vanished\\nfields. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with\\nvigorous freedom, instead of languishing into  parish like stray\\npaupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall,\\nnot far off, on which  peaches ripened in their season.\\n  The summer light struck into  corner brilliantly in  earlier\\npart of  day; but, when  streets grew hot,  corner was in\\nshadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond\\nit into a glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful,\\na wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from  raging\\nstreets.\\n  There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and\\nthere was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large still house,\\nwhere several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof\\nlittle was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at\\nnight. In a building at  back, attainable by a courtyard where a\\nplane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made,\\nand silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some\\nmysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of  wall of\\n front hall- as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a\\nsimilar conversion of all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of\\na lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming\\nmaker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen.\\nOccasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed  hall,\\nor a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard\\nacross  courtyard, or a thump from  golden giant. These,\\nhowever, were only  exceptions required to prove  rule that\\n sparrows in  plane-tree behind  house, and  echoes in \\ncorner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto\\nSaturday night.\\n  Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation,\\nand its revival in  floating whispers of his story, brought him.\\nHis scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting\\ningenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request,\\nand he earned as much as he wanted.\\n  These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry\\'s knowledge, thoughts, and\\nnotice, when he rang  door-bell of  tranquil house in \\ncorner, on  fine Sunday afternoon.\\n  \"Doctor Manette at home?\"\\n  Expected home.\\n  \"Miss Lucie at home?\"\\n  Expected home.\\n  \"Miss Pross at home?\"\\n  Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to\\nanticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of\\n fact.\\n  \"As I am at home myself,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"I\\'ll go upstairs.\"\\n  Although  Doctor\\'s daughter had known nothing of  country of\\nher birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that\\nability to make much of little means, which is one of its most\\nuseful and most agreeable characteristics. Simple as  furniture\\nwas, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but\\nfor their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful. The\\ndisposition of everything in  rooms, from  largest object to \\nleast;  arrangement of colours,  elegant variety and contrast\\nobtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good\\nsense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of\\ntheir originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him,  very\\nchairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar\\nexpression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved?\\n  There were three rooms on a floor, and,  doors by which they\\ncommunicated being put open that  air might pass freely through\\nthem all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful\\nresemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to\\nanother. The first was  best room, and in it were Lucie\\'s birds,\\nand flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and box of\\nwater-colours;  second was  Doctor\\'s consulting-room, used\\nalso as  dining-room;  third, changingly speckled by \\nrustle of  plane-tree in  yard, was  Doctor\\'s bedroom, and\\nthere, in a corner, stood  disused shoemaker\\'s bench and tray of\\ntools, much as it had stood on  fifth floor of  dismal house\\nby  wine-shop, in  suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.\\n  \"I wonder,\" said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, \"that he\\nkeeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!\"\\n  \"And why wonder at that?\" was  abrupt inquiry that made him\\nstart.\\n  It proceeded from Miss Pross,  wild red woman, strong of hand,\\nwhose acquaintance he had first made at  Royal George Hotel at\\nDover, and had since improved.\\n  \"I should have thought-\" Mr. Lorry began.\\n  \"Pooh! You\\'d have thought!\" said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.\\n  \"How do you do?\" inquired that lady then- sharply, and yet as if\\nto express that she bore him no malice.\\n  \"I am pretty well, I thank you,\" answered Mr. Lorry, with\\nmeekness; \"how are you?\"\\n  \"Nothing to boast of,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  \"Indeed?\"\\n  \"Ah! indeed!\" said Miss Pross. \"I am very much put out about my\\nLadybird.\"\\n  \"Indeed?\"\\n  \"For gracious sake say something else besides \\'indeed,\\' or you\\'ll\\nfidget me to death,\" said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated\\nfrom stature) was shortness.\\n  \"Really, then?\" said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.\\n  \"Really, is bad enough,\" returned Miss Pross, \"but better. Yes, I am\\nvery much put out.\"\\n  \"May I ask  cause?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of\\nLadybird, to come here looking after her,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  \"Do dozens come for that purpose?\"\\n  \"Hundreds,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before\\nher time and since) that whenever her original proposition was\\nquestioned, she exaggerated it.\\n  \"Dear me!\" said Mr. Lorry, as  safest remark he could think of.\\n  \"I have lived with  darling- or  darling has lived with me,\\nand paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you\\nmay take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either\\nmyself or her for nothing- since she was ten years old. And it\\'s\\nreally very hard,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his\\nhead; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak\\nthat would fit anything.\\n  \"All sorts of people who are not in  least degree worthy of \\npet, are always turning up,\" said Miss Pross. \"When you began it--\"\\n  \"I began it, Miss Pross?\"\\n  \"Didn\\'t you? Who brought her father to life?\"\\n  \"Oh! If that was beginning it--\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"It wasn\\'t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was\\nhard enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette,\\nexcept that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no\\nimputation on him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should\\nbe, under any circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard\\nto have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I\\ncould have forgiven him), to take Ladybird\\'s affections away from me.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her\\nby this time to be, beneath  service of her eccentricity, one of\\nthose unselfish creatures- found only among women- who will, for\\npure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth\\nwhen they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to\\naccomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to\\nbright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives. He knew\\nenough of  world to know that there is nothing in it better than\\n faithful service of  heart; so rendered and so free from any\\nmercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in \\nretributive arrangements made by his own mind- we all make such\\narrangements, more or less- he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to \\nlower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by\\nNature and Art, who had balances at Tellson\\'s.\\n  \"There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,\" said\\nMiss Pross; \"and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn\\'t made a\\nmistake in life.\"\\n  Here again: Mr. Lorry\\'s inquiries into Miss Pross\\'s personal history\\nhad established  fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless\\nscoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake\\nto speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for\\nevermore, with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross\\'s fidelity of\\nbelief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake)\\nwas quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his\\ngood opinion of her.\\n  \"As we happen to be alone for  moment, and are both people of\\nbusiness,\" he said, when they had got back to  drawing-room and had\\nsat down there in friendly relations, \"Let me ask you- does \\nDoctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to  shoemaking time,\\nyet?\"\\n  \"Never.\"\\n  \"And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?\"\\n  \"Ah!\" returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. \"But I don\\'t say he\\ndon\\'t refer to it within himself.\"\\n  \"Do you believe that he thinks of it much?\"\\n  \"I do,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  \"Do you imagine--\" Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him\\nup short with:\\n  \"Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.\"\\n  \"I stand corrected; do you suppose- you go so far as to suppose,\\nsometimes?\"\\n  \"Now and then,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  \"Do you suppose,\" Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in\\nhis bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, \"that Doctor Manette has\\nany theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative\\nto  cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to  name of\\nhis oppressor?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.\"\\n  \"And that is--?\"\\n  \"That she thinks he has.\"\\n  \"Now don\\'t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a\\nmere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.\"\\n  \"Dull?\" Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.\\n  Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, \"No,\\nno, no. Surely not. To return to business:- Is it not remarkable\\nthat Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are an\\nwell assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will\\nnot say with me, though he had business relations with me many years\\nago, and we are now intimate; I will say with  fair daughter to\\nwhom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached\\nto him? Believe me, Miss Pross, I don\\'t approach  topic with you,\\nout of curiosity, but out of zealous interest.\"\\n  \"Well! To  best of my understanding, and bad\\'s  best, you\\'ll\\ntell me,\" said Miss Pross, softened by  tone of  apology, \"he is\\nafraid of  whole subject.\"\\n  \"Afraid?\"\\n  \"It\\'s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It\\'s a dreadful\\nremembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not\\nknowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never\\nfeel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn\\'t make \\nsubject pleasant, I should think.\"\\n  It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. \"True,\"\\nsaid he, \"and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my\\nmind, Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that\\nsuppression always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and\\n uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present\\nconfidence.\"\\n  \"Can\\'t be helped,\" said Miss Pross, shaking her head. \"Touch that\\nstring, and he instantly changes for  worse. Better leave it alone.\\nIn short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets\\nup in  dead of  night, and will be heard, by us overhead\\nthere, walking up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird\\nhas learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down,\\nwalking up and down, in his old prison. She hurries to him, and they\\ngo on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he\\nis composed. But he never says a word of  true reason of his\\nrestlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to\\nhim. In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and\\ndown together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.\"\\n  Notwithstanding Miss Pross\\'s denial of her own imagination, there\\nwas a perception of  pain of being monotonously haunted by one\\nsad idea, in her repetition of  phrase, walking up and down,\\nwhich testified to her possessing such a thing.\\n  The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it\\nhad begun to echo so resoundingly to  tread of coming feet, that it\\nseemed as though  very mention of that weary pacing to and fro\\nhad set it going.\\n  \"Here they are!\" said Miss Pross, rising to break up  conference;\\n\"and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!\"\\n  It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a\\npeculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at  open window,\\nlooking for  father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied\\nthey would never approach. Not only would  echoes die away, as\\nthough  steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never\\ncame would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when\\nthey seemed close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last\\nappear, and Miss Pross was ready at  street door to receive them.\\n  Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim,\\ntaking off her darling\\'s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and\\ntouching it up with  ends of her handkerchief, and blowing  dust\\noff it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing\\nher rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in\\nher own hair if she had been  vainest and handsomest of women.\\nHer darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking\\nher, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her-\\nwhich last she only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt,\\nwould have retired to her own chamber and cried. The Doctor was a\\npleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she\\nspoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in\\nthem as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible.\\nMr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his\\nlittle wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him\\nin his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds of people came to\\nsee  sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for  fulfilment of\\nMiss Pross\\'s prediction.\\n  Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In  arrangements of\\n little household, Miss Pross took charge of  lower regions, and\\nalways acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest\\nquality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in\\ntheir contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could\\nbe better. Miss Pross\\'s friendship being of  thoroughly practical\\nkind, she had ravaged Soho and  adjacent provinces, in search of\\nimpoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns,\\nwould impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and\\ndaughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that \\nwoman and girl who formed  staff of domestics regarded her as quite\\na Sorceress, or Cinderella\\'s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl,\\na rabbit, a vegetable or two from  garden, and change them into\\nanything she pleased.\\n  On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at  Doctor\\'s table, but on other\\ndays persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in \\nlower regions, or in her own room on  second floor- a blue chamber,\\nto which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this\\noccasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird\\'s pleasant face and\\npleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so  dinner\\nwas very pleasant, too.\\n  It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that \\nwine should be carried out under  plane-tree, and they should sit\\nthere in  air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about\\nher, they went out under  plane-tree, and she carried  wine down\\nfor  special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself,\\nsome time before, as Mr. Lorry\\'s cup-bearer; and while they sat\\nunder  plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished.\\nMysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and\\n plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads.\\n  Still,  Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay\\npresented himself while they were sitting under  plane-tree, but he\\nwas only One.\\n  Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss\\nPross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in  head and body,\\nand retired into  house. She was not unfrequently  victim of\\nthis disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \"a fit\\nof  jerks.\"\\n  The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young.\\nThe resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times,\\nand as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he\\nresting his arm on  back of her chair, it was very agreeable to\\ntrace  likeness.\\n  He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual\\nvivacity. \"Pray, Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under\\n plane-tree- and he said it in  natural pursuit of  topic\\nin hand, which happened to be  old buildings of London- \"have you\\nseen much of  Tower?\"\\n  \"Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough\\nof it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\"\\n  \"I have been there, as you remember,\" said Darnay, with a smile,\\nthough reddening a little angrily, \"in another character, and not in a\\ncharacter that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me\\na curious thing when I was there.\"\\n  \"What was that?\" Lucie asked.\\n  \"In making some alterations,  workmen came upon an old dungeon,\\nwhich had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of\\nits inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by\\nprisoners- dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner\\nstone in an angle of  wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone\\nto execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were\\ndone with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady\\nhand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more\\ncarefully examined,  last letter was found to be G.  There was no\\nrecord or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many\\nfruitless guesses were made what  name could have been. At\\nlength, it was suggested that  letters were not initials, but \\ncomplete word, DIG. The floor was examined very carefully under \\ninscription, and, in  earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some\\nfragment of paving, were found  ashes of a paper, mingled with\\n ashes of a small leathern case or bag. What  unknown prisoner\\nhad written will never be read, but he had written something, and\\nhidden it away to keep it from  gaoler.\"\\n  \"My father,\" exclaimed Lucie, \"you are ill!\"\\n  He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner\\nand his look quite terrified them all.\\n  \"No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and\\nthey made me start. We had better go in.\"\\n  He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in\\nlarge drops, and he showed  back of his hand with rain-drops on it.\\nBut, he said not a single word in reference to  discovery that had\\nbeen told of, and, as they went into  house,  business eye of\\nMr. Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it\\nturned towards Charles Darnay,  same singular look that had been\\nupon it when it turned towards him in  passages of  Court House.\\n  He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had\\ndoubts of his business eye. The arm of  golden giant in  hall\\nwas not more steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to\\nthem that he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever\\nwould be), and that  rain had startled him.\\n  Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of  jerks\\nupon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in,\\nbut he made only Two.\\n  The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors\\nand windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When  tea-table\\nwas done with, they all moved to one of  windows, and looked out\\ninto  heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside\\nher; Carton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white,\\nand some of  thunder-gusts that whirled into  corner, caught\\nthem up to  ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.\\n  \"The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,\" said\\nDoctor Manette. \"It comes slowly.\"\\n  \"It comes surely,\" said Carton.\\n  They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as\\npeople in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.\\n  There was a great hurry in  streets of people speeding away to\\nget shelter before  storm broke;  wonderful corner for echoes\\nresounded with  echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a\\nfootstep was there.\\n  \"A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!\" said Darnay, when\\nthey had listened for a while.\\n  \"Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?\" asked Lucie. \"Sometimes, I\\nhave sat here of an evening, until I have fancied- but even \\nshade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so\\nblack and solemn--\"\\n  \"Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.\"\\n  \"It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we\\noriginate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have\\nsometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made\\n echoes out to be  echoes of all  footsteps that are coming\\nby-and-bye into our lives.\"\\n  \"There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be\\nso,\" Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.\\n  The footsteps were incessant, and  hurry of them became more\\nand more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with  tread of\\nfeet; some, as it seemed, under  windows; some, as it seemed, in\\n room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping\\naltogether; all in  distant streets, and not one within sight.\\n  \"Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss\\nManette, or are we to divide them among us?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but\\nyou asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone,\\nand then I have imagined them  footsteps of  people who are to\\ncome into my life, and my father\\'s.\"\\n  \"I take them into mine!\" said Carton. \"I ask no questions and make\\nno stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss\\nManette, and I see them-- by  Lightning.\" He added  last\\nwords, after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging\\nin  window.\\n  \"And I hear them!\" he added again, after a peal of thunder. \"Here\\nthey come, fast, fierce, and furious!\"\\n  It was  rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped\\nhim, for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder\\nand lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a\\nmoment\\'s interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after  moon\\nrose at midnight.\\n  The great bell of Saint Paul\\'s was striking One in  cleared\\nair, when Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a\\nlantern, set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were\\nsolitary patches of road on  way between Soho and Clerkenwell,\\nand Mr. Lorry, mindful of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this\\nservice: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.\\n  \"What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,\" said Mr. Lorry,\\n\"to bring  dead out of their graves.\"\\n  \"I never see  night myself, master- nor yet I don\\'t expect to-\\nwhat would do that,\" answered Jerry.\\n  \"Good night, Mr. Carton,\" said  man of business. \"Good night, Mr.\\nDarnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!\"\\n\\n  Perhaps. Perhaps, see  great crowd of people with its rush and\\nroar, bearing down upon them, too.\\n  VII\\n  MONSEIGNEUR IN TOWN\\n\\n  MONSEIGNEUR, one of  great lords in power at  Court, held\\nhis fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was\\nin his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries,  Holiest of\\nHoliests to  crowd of worshippers in  suite of rooms without.\\nMonseigneur was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow\\na great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds\\nsupposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning\\'s\\nchocolate could not so much as get into  throat of Monseigneur,\\nwithout  aid of four strong men besides  Cook.\\n  Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and\\n Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches\\nin his pocket, emulative of  noble and chaste fashion set by\\nMonseigneur, to conduct  happy chocolate to Monseigneur\\'s lips. One\\nlacquey carried  chocolate-pot into  sacred presence; a\\nsecond, milled and frothed  chocolate with  little instrument he\\nbore for that function; a third, presented  favoured napkin; a\\nfourth (he of  two gold watches), poured  chocolate out. It\\nwas impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these\\nattendants on  chocolate and hold his high place under  admiring\\nHeavens. Deep would have been  blot upon his escutcheon if his\\nchocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have\\ndied of two.\\n  Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where \\nComedy and  Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur\\nwas out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So\\npolite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that  Comedy and \\nGrand Opera had far more influence with him in  tiresome articles\\nof state affairs and state secrets, than  needs of all France. A\\nhappy circumstance for France, as  like always is for all countries\\nsimilarly favoured!- always was for England (by way of example), in\\n regretted days of  merry Stuart who sold it.\\n  Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business,\\nwhich was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular\\npublic business, Monseigneur had  other truly noble idea that it\\nmust all go his way- tend to his own power and pocket. Of his\\npleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had  other truly\\nnoble idea, that  world was made for them. The text of his order\\n(altered from  original by only a pronoun, which is not much)\\nran: \"The earth and  fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.\"\\n  Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept\\ninto his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both\\nclasses of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General.\\nAs to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything\\nat all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who\\ncould; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich,\\nand Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was\\ngrowing poor. Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent,\\nwhile there was yet time to ward off  impending veil, \\ncheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize\\nupon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family. Which Farmer-General,\\ncarrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on  top of it, was\\nnow among  company in  outer rooms, much prostrated before by\\nmankind- always excepting superior mankind of  blood of\\nMonseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with \\nloftiest contempt.\\n  A sumptuous man was  Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his\\nstables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women\\nwaited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and\\nforage where he could,  Farmer-General- howsoever his matrimonial\\nrelations conduced to social morality- was at least  greatest\\nreality among  personages who attended at  hotel of\\nMonseigneur that day.\\n  For,  rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned\\nwith every device of decoration that  taste and skin of  time\\ncould achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with\\nany reference to  scarecrows in  rags and nightcaps elsewhere\\n(and not so far off, either, but that  watching towers of Notre\\nDame, almost equidistant from  two extremes, could see them\\nboth), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business-\\nif that could have been anybody\\'s business, at  house of\\nMonseigneur. Military officers destitute of military knowledge;\\nnaval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion\\nof affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of  worst world worldly, with\\nsensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for\\ntheir several callings all lying horribly in pretending to belong to\\nthem, but all nearly or remotely of  order of Monseigneur, and\\ntherefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to\\nbe got; these were to be told off by  score and  score. People\\nnot immediately connected with Monseigneur or  State, yet equally\\nunconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in\\ntravelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no\\nless abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty\\nremedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their\\ncourtly patients in  ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who\\nhad discovered every kind of remedy for  little evils with which\\n State was touched, except  remedy of setting to work in earnest\\nto root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any\\nears they could lay hold of, at  reception of Monseigneur.\\nUnbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling  world with words,\\nand making card-towers of Babel to scale  skies with, talked with\\nUnbelieving Chemists who had an eye on  transmutation of metals, at\\nthis wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite\\ngentlemen of  finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time-\\nand has been since- to be known by its fruits of indifference to every\\nnatural subject of human interest, were in  most exemplary state of\\nexhaustion, at  hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these\\nvarious notabilities left behind them in  fine world of Paris, that\\n spies among  assembled devotees of Monseigneur- forming a\\ngoodly half of  polite company- would have found it hard to\\ndiscover among  angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in\\nher manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except\\nfor  mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world-\\nwhich does not go far towards  realisation of  name of mother-\\nthere was no such thing known to  fashion. Peasant women kept \\nunfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming\\ngrandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.\\n  The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in\\nattendance upon Monseigneur. In  outermost room were half a dozen\\nexceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague\\nmisgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong. As a\\npromising way of setting them right, half of  half-dozen had become\\nmembers of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then\\nconsidering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar,\\nand turn cataleptic on  spot- thereby setting up a highly\\nintelligible finger-post to  Future, for Monseigneur\\'s guidance.\\nBesides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into\\nanother sect, which mended matters with a jargon about \" Centre\\nof Truth:\" holding that Man had got out of  Centre of Truth-\\nwhich did not need much demonstration- but had not got out of \\nCircumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of \\nCircumference, and was even to be shoved back into  Centre, by\\nfasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much\\ndiscoursing with spirits went on- and it did a world of good which\\nnever became manifest.\\n  But,  comfort was, that all  company at  grand hotel of\\nMonseigneur were perfectly dressed. If  Day of Judgment had only\\nbeen ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been\\neternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of\\nhair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended,\\nsuch gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to \\nsense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever.\\nThe exquisite gentlemen of  finest breeding wore little pendent\\ntrinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters\\nrang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and\\nwith  rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a\\nflutter in  air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring\\nhunger far away.\\n  Dress was  one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping\\nall things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball\\nthat was never to leave off. From  Palace of  Tuileries, through\\nMonseigneur and  whole Court, through  Chambers,  Tribunals\\nof Justice, and all society (except  scarecrows),  Fancy Ball\\ndescended to  Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of  charm,\\nwas required to officiate \"frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat,\\npumps, and white silk stockings.\" At  gallows and  wheel- axe\\nwas a rarity- Monsieur Paris, as it was  episcopal mode among his\\nbrother Professors of  provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and  rest,\\nto call him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among \\ncompany at Monseigneur\\'s reception in that seventeen hundred and\\neightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted\\nin a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk\\nstockinged, would see  very stars out!\\n  Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his\\nchocolate, caused  doors of  Holiest of Holiests to be thrown\\nopen, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and\\nfawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in\\nbody and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven- which may\\nhave been one among other reasons why  worshippers of Monseigneur\\nnever troubled it.\\n  Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one\\nhappy slave and a wave of  hand on another, Monseigneur affably\\npassed through his rooms to  remote region of  Circumference\\nof Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in\\ndue course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by \\nchocolate sprites, and was seen no more.\\n  The show being over,  flutter in  air became quite a little\\nstorm, and  precious little bells went ringing down-stairs. There\\nwas soon but one person left of all  crowd, and he, with his hat\\nunder his arm and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among \\nmirrors on his way out.\\n  \"I devote you,\" said this person, stopping at  last door on his\\nway, and turning in  direction of  sanctuary, \"to  Devil!\"\\n  With that, he shook  snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken\\n dust from his feet, and quietly walked down-stairs.\\n  He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in\\nmanner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent\\npaleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on\\nit. The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly\\npinched at  top of each nostril. In those two compressions, or\\ndints,  only little change that  face ever showed, resided. They\\npersisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally\\ndilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they\\ngave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to  whole countenance.\\nExamined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be\\nfound in  line of  mouth, and  lines of  orbits of \\neyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in  effect of\\n face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.\\n  Its owner went down-stairs into  courtyard, got into his\\ncarriage, and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at \\nreception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might\\nhave been warmer in his manner. It appeared, under \\ncircumstances, rather agreeable to him to see  common people\\ndispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being\\nrun down. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and \\nfurious recklessness of  man brought no check into  face, or\\nto  lips, of  master. The complaint had sometimes made itself\\naudible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in  narrow\\nstreets without footways,  fierce patrician custom of hard\\ndriving endangered and maimed  mere vulgar in a barbarous manner.\\nBut, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in\\nthis matter, as in all others,  common wretches were left to get\\nout of their difficulties as they could.\\n  With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of\\nconsideration not easy to be understood in these days,  carriage\\ndashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming\\nbefore it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out\\nof its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of\\nits wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry\\nfrom a number of voices, and  horses reared and plunged.\\n  But for  latter inconvenience,  carriage probably would not\\nhave stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave\\ntheir wounded behind, and why not? But  frightened valet had got\\ndown in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at  horses\\' bridles.\\n  \"What has gone wrong?\" said Monsieur, calmly looking out.\\n  A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among \\nfeet of  horses, and had laid it on  basement of  fountain,\\nand was down in  mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.\\n  \"Pardon, Monsieur  Marquis!\" said a ragged and submissive man,\\n\"it is a child.\"\\n  \"Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\"\\n  \"Excuse me, Monsieur  Marquis- it is a pity- yes.\"\\n  The fountain was a little removed; for  street opened, where it\\nwas, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As  tall man\\nsuddenly got up from  ground, and came running at  carriage,\\nMonsieur  Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his\\nsword-hilt.\\n  \"Killed!\" shrieked  man, in wild desperation, extending both arms\\nat their length above his head, and staring at him. \"Dead!\"\\n  The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur  Marquis. There\\nwas nothing revealed by  many eyes that looked at him but\\nwatchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger.\\nNeither did  people say anything; after  first cry, they had\\nbeen silent, and they remained so. The voice of  submissive man who\\nhad spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur\\n Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere\\nrats come out of their holes.\\n  He took out his purse.\\n  \"It is extraordinary to me,\" said he, \"that you people cannot take\\ncare of yourselves and your children. One or  other of you is for\\never in  way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses.\\nSee! Give him that.\"\\n  He threw out a gold coin for  valet to pick up, and all  heads\\ncraned forward that all  eyes might look down at it as it fell. The\\ntall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, \"Dead!\"\\n  He was arrested by  quick arrival of another man, for whom \\nrest made way. On seeing him,  miserable creature fell upon his\\nshoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to  fountain, where some\\nwomen were stooping over  motionless bundle, and moving gently\\nabout it. They were as silent, however, as  men.\\n  \"I know all, I know all,\" said  last comer. \"Be a brave man, my\\nGaspard! It is better for  poor little plaything to die so, than to\\nlive. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an\\nhour as happily?\"\\n  \"You are a philosopher, you there,\" said  Marquis, smiling.\\n\"How do they call you?\"\\n  \"They call me Defarge.\"\\n  \"Of what trade?\"\\n  \"Monsieur  Marquis, vendor of wine.\"\\n  \"Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,\" said  Marquis,\\nthrowing him another gold coin, \"and spend it as you will. The\\nhorses there; are they right?\"\\n  Without deigning to look at  assemblage a second time, Monsieur\\n Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away\\nwith  air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common\\nthing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his\\nease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and\\nringing on its floor.\\n  \"Hold!\" said Monsieur  Marquis. \"Hold  horses! Who threw\\nthat?\"\\n  He looked to  spot where Defarge  vendor of wine had stood,\\na moment before; but  wretched father was grovelling on his face on\\n pavement in that spot, and  figure that stood beside him was\\n figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.\\n  \"You dogs!\" said  Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged\\nfront, except as to  spots on his nose: \"I would ride over any of\\nyou very willingly, and exterminate you from  earth. If I knew\\nwhich rascal threw at  carriage, and if that brigand were\\nsufficiently near it, he should be crushed under  wheels.\"\\n  So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their\\nexperience of what such a man could do to them, within  law and\\nbeyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised.\\nAmong  men, not one. But  woman who stood knitting looked up\\nsteadily, and looked  Marquis in  face. It was not for his\\ndignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and\\nover all  other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and\\ngave  word \"Go on!\"\\n  He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick\\nsuccession;  Minister,  State-Projector,  Farmer-General, \\nDoctor,  Lawyer,  Ecclesiastic,  Grand Opera,  Comedy, \\nwhole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The\\nrats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained\\nlooking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them\\nand  spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and\\nthrough which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle\\nand hidden himself away with it, when  women who had tended \\nbundle while it lay on  base of  fountain, sat there watching\\n running of  water and  rolling of  Fancy Ball- when \\none woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with\\n steadfastness of Fate. The water of  fountain ran,  swift\\nriver ran,  day ran into evening, so much life in  city ran into\\ndeath according to rule, time and tide waited for no man,  rats\\nwere sleeping close together in their dark holes again,  Fancy Ball\\nwas lighted up at supper, all things ran their course.\\n  VIII\\n  MONSEIGNEUR IN THE COUNTRY\\n\\n  A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE, with  corn bright in it, but not abundant.\\nPatches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor\\npeas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for\\nwheat. On inanimate nature, as on  men and women who cultivated it,\\na prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating\\nunwillingly- a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.\\n  Monsieur  Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have\\nbeen lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions,\\nfagged up a steep hill. A blush on  countenance of Monsieur \\nMarquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from\\nwithin; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his\\ncontrol-  setting sun.\\n  The sunset struck so brilliantly into  travelling carriage when\\nit gained  hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson.\\n\"It will die out,\" said Monsieur  Marquis, glancing at his hands,\\n\"directly.\"\\n  In effect,  sun was so low that it dipped at  moment. When \\nheavy drag had been adjusted to  wheel, and  carriage slid\\ndown hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust,  red glow\\ndeparted quickly;  sun and  Marquis going down together, there\\nwas no glow left when  drag was taken off.\\n  But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little\\nvillage at  bottom of  hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a\\nchurchtower, a windmill, a forest for  chase, and a crag with a\\nfortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening\\nobjects as  night drew on,  Marquis looked, with  air of\\none who was coming near home.\\n  The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor\\ntannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor\\nfountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All\\npoor a its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their\\ndoors, shredding spare onions and  like for supper, while many were\\nat  fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small\\nyieldings of  earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what\\nmade them poor, were not wanting;  tax for  state,  tax for\\n church,  tax for  lord, tax local and tax general, were to\\nbe paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription\\nin  little village, until  wonder was, that there was any\\nvillage left unswallowed.\\n  Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to  men and\\nwomen, their choice on earth was stated in  prospect- Life on \\nlowest terms that could sustain it, down in  little village under\\n ill; or captivity and Death in  dominant prison on  crag.\\n  Heralded by a courier in advance, and by  cracking of his\\npostilions\\' whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in \\nevening air, as if he came attended by  Furies, Monsieur \\nMarquis drew up in his travelling carriage at  posting-house\\ngate. It was hard by  fountain, and  peasants suspended their\\noperations to look at him. He looked at them, and saw in them, without\\nknowing it,  slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and\\nfigure, that was to make  meagreness of Frenchmen an English\\nsuperstition which should survive  truth through  best part of a\\nhundred years.\\n  Monsieur  Marquis cast his eyes over  submissive faces that\\ndrooped before him, as  like of himself had drooped before\\nMonseigneur of  Court- only  difference was, that these faces\\ndrooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate- when a grizzled mender\\nof  roads joined  group.\\n  \"Bring me hither that fellow!\" said  Marquis to  courier.\\n  The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and  other fellows closed\\nround to look and listen, in  manner of  people at  Paris\\nfountain.\\n  \"I passed you on  road?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, it is true. I had  honour of being passed on \\nroad.\"\\n  \"Coming up  hill, and at  top of  hill, both?\\n  \"Monseigneur, it is true.\"\\n  \"What did you look at, so fixedly?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, I looked at  man.\"\\n  He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under\\n carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under  carriage.\\n  \"What man, pig? And why look there?\"\\n  \"Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by  chain of  shoe-  drag.\"\\n  \"Who?\" demanded  traveller.\\n  \"Monseigneur,  man.\"\\n  \"May  Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call  man? You\\nknow all  men of this part of  country. Who was he?\"\\n  \"Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of  country.\\nOf all  days of my life, I never saw him.\"\\n  \"Swinging by  chain? To be suffocated?\"\\n  \"With your gracious permission, that was  wonder of it,\\nMonseigneur. His head hanging over- like this!\"\\n  He turned himself sideways to  carriage, and leaned back, with\\nhis face thrown up to  sky, and his head hanging down; then\\nrecovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.\\n  \"What was he like?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, he was whiter than  miller. All covered with\\ndust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!\"\\n  The picture produced an immense sensation in  little crowd; but\\nall eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at\\nMonsieur  Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre\\non his conscience.\\n  \"Truly, you did well,\" said  Marquis, felicitously sensible\\nthat such vermin were not to ruffle him, \"to see a thief\\naccompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah!\\nPut him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!\"\\n  Monsieur Gabelle was  Postmaster, and some other taxing\\nfunctionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to\\nassist at this examination, and had held  examined by  drapery\\nof his arm in an official manner.\\n  \"Bah! Go aside!\" said Monsieur Gabelle.\\n  \"Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village\\nto-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.\"\\n  \"Did he run away, fellow?- where is that Accursed?\"\\n  The accursed was already under  carriage with some half-dozen\\nparticular friends, pointing out  chain with his blue cap. Some\\nhalf-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and\\npresented him breathless to Monsieur  Marquis.\\n  \"Did  man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for  drag?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over  hill-side, head\\nfirst, as a person plunges into  river.\"\\n  \"See to it, Gabelle. Go on!\"\\n  The half-dozen who were peering at  chain were still among \\nwheels, like sheep;  wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky\\nto save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or\\nthey might not have been so fortunate.\\n  The burst with which  carriage started out of  village and\\nup  rise beyond, was soon checked by  steepness of  hill.\\nGradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward\\namong  many sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with\\na thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of  Furies,\\nquietly mended  points to  lashes of their whips;  valet\\nwalked by  horses;  courier was audible, trotting on ahead\\ninto  dim distance.\\n  At  steepest point of  hill there was a little\\nburial-ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on\\nit; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic\\ncarver, but he had studied  figure from  life- his own life,\\nmaybe- for it was dreadfully spare and thin.\\n  To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been\\ngrowing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She\\nturned her head as  carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and\\npresented herself at  carriage-door.\\n  \"It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.\"\\n  With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,\\nMonseigneur looked out.\\n  \"How, then! What is it? Always petitions!\"\\n  \"Monseigneur. For  love of  great God! My husband, \\nforester.\"\\n  \"What of your husband,  forester? Always  same with you\\npeople. He cannot pay something?\"\\n  \"He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.\"\\n  \"Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?\"\\n  \"Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of\\npoor grass.\"\\n  \"Well?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?\"\\n  \"Again, well?\"\\n  She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of\\npassionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands\\ntogether with wild energy, and laid one of them on \\ncarriage-door- tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human\\nbreast, and could be expected to feel  appealing touch.\\n  \"Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband\\ndied of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.\"\\n  \"Again, well? Can I feed them?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur,  good God knows; but I don\\'t ask it. My petition\\nis, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband\\'s name, may be\\nplaced over him to show where he lies. Otherwise,  place will be\\nquickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of  same\\nmalady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.\\nMonseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much\\nwant. Monseigneur! Monseigneur!\"\\n  The valet had put her away from  door,  carriage had broken\\ninto a brisk trot,  postilions had quickened  pace, she was left\\nfar behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by  Furies, was rapidly\\ndiminishing  league or two of distance that remained between him\\nand his chateau.\\n  The sweet scents of  summer night rose all around him, and\\nrose, as  rain falls, impartially, on  dusty, ragged, and\\ntoil-worn group at  fountain not far away; to whom  mender of\\nroads, with  aid of  blue cap without which he was nothing,\\nstill enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear\\nit. By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by\\none, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as \\ncasements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up\\ninto  sky instead of having been extinguished.\\n  The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging\\ntrees, was upon Monsieur  Marquis by that time; and  shadow\\nwas exchanged for  light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped,\\nand  great door of his chateau was opened to him.\\n  \"Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, not yet.\"\\n  IX\\n  THE GORGON\\'S HEAD\\n\\n  IT WAS a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur \\nMarquis, with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone\\nsweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before  principal\\ndoor. A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and\\nstone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads\\nof lions, in all directions. As if  Gorgon\\'s head had surveyed\\nit, when it was finished, two centuries ago.\\n  Up  broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur  Marquis, flambeau\\npreceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing  darkness\\nto elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in  roof of  great\\npile of stable building away among  trees. All else was so quiet,\\nthat  flambeau carried up  steps, and  other flambeau held at\\n great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state,\\ninstead of being in  open night-air. Other sound than  owl\\'s\\nvoice there was none, save  falling of a fountain into its stone\\nbasin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath\\nby  hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their\\nbreath again.\\n  The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur  Marquis\\ncrossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives\\nof  chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips,\\nof which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt \\nweight when his lord was angry.\\n  Avoiding  larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for \\nnight, Monsieur  Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before,\\nwent up  staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open,\\nadmitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his\\nbed-chamber and two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted\\nfloors, great dogs upon  hearths for  burning of wood in\\nwinter time, and all luxuries befitting  state of a marquis in a\\nluxurious age and country. The fashion of  last Louis but one, of\\n line that was never to break-  fourteenth Louis- was\\nconspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many\\nobjects that were illustrations of old pages in  history of France.\\n  A supper-table was laid for two, in  third of  rooms; a\\nround room, in one of  chateau\\'s four extinguisher-topped towers. A\\nsmall lofty room, with its window wide open, and  wooden\\njalousie-blinds closed, so that  dark night only showed in slight\\nhorizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone\\ncolour.\\n  \"My nephew,\" said  Marquis, glancing at  supper preparation;\\n\"they said he was not arrived.\"\\n  Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.\\n  \"Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave\\n table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.\"\\n  In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to\\nhis sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to  window,\\nand he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to\\nhis lips, when he put it down.\\n  \"What is that?\" he calmly asked, looking with attention at \\nhorizontal lines of black and stone colour.\\n  \"Monseigneur? That?\"\\n  \"Outside  blinds. Open  blinds.\"\\n  It was done.\\n  \"Well?\"\\n  \"Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and  night are all that\\nare here.\"\\n  The servant who spoke, had thrown  blinds wide, had looked out\\ninto  vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him,\\nlooking round for instructions.\\n  \"Good,\" said  imperturbable master. \"Close them again.\"\\n  That was done too, and  Marquis went on with his supper. He was\\nhalf way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,\\nhearing  sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to \\nfront of  chateau.\\n  \"Ask who is arrived.\"\\n  It was  nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues\\nbehind Monseigneur, early in  afternoon. He had diminished \\ndistance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on\\n road. He had heard of Monseigneur, at  posting-houses, as being\\nbefore him.\\n  He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then\\nand there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while\\nhe came. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.\\n  Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake\\nhands.\\n  \"You left Paris yesterday, sir?\" he said to Monseigneur, as he\\ntook his seat at table.\\n  \"Yesterday. And you?\"\\n  \"I come direct.\"\\n  \"From London?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"You have been a long time coming,\" said  Marquis, with a smile.\\n  \"On  contrary; I come direct.\"\\n  \"Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on  journey; a long time\\nintending  journey.\"\\n  \"I have been detained by\"-  nephew stopped a moment in his\\nanswer- \"various business.\"\\n  \"Without doubt,\" said  polished uncle.\\n  So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between\\nthem. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, \\nnephew, looking at  uncle and meeting  eyes of  face that was\\nlike a fine mask, opened a conversation.\\n  \"I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing  object\\nthat took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril;\\nbut it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it\\nwould have sustained me.\\n  \"Not to death,\" said  uncle; \"it is not necessary to say, to\\ndeath.\"\\n  \"I doubt, sir,\" returned  nephew, \"whether, if it had carried\\nme to  utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me\\nthere.\"\\n  The deepened marks in  nose, and  lengthening of  fine\\nstraight lines in  cruel face, looked ominous as to that;  uncle\\nmade a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form\\nof good breeding that it was not reassuring.\\n  \"Indeed, sir,\" pursued  nephew, \"for anything I know, you may\\nhave expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to \\nsuspicious circumstances that surrounded me.\"\\n  \"No, no, no,\" said  uncle, pleasantly.\\n  \"But, however that may be,\" resumed  nephew, glancing at him with\\ndeep distrust, \"I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,\\nand would know no scruple as to means.\"\\n  \"My friend, I told you so,\" said  uncle, with a fine pulsation in\\n two marks. \"Do me  favour to recall that I told you so, long\\nago.\"\\n  \"I recall it.\"\\n  \"Thank you,\" said  Marquis- very sweetly indeed.\\n  His tone lingered in  air, almost like  tone of a musical\\ninstrument.\\n  \"In effect, sir,\" pursued  nephew, \"I believe it to be at once\\nyour bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a\\nprison in France here.\"\\n  \"I do not quite understand,\" returned  uncle, sipping his coffee.\\n\"Dare I ask you to explain?\"\\n  \"I believe that if you were not in disgrace with  Court, and\\nhad not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de\\ncachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.\"\\n  \"It is possible,\" said  uncle, with great calmness. \"For \\nhonour of  family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that\\nextent. Pray excuse me!\"\\n  \"I perceive that, happily for me,  Reception of  day before\\nyesterday was, as usual, a cold one,\" observed  nephew.\\n  \"I would not say happily, my friend,\" returned  uncle, with\\nrefined politeness; \"I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity\\nfor consideration, surrounded by  advantages of solitude, might\\ninfluence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence\\nit for yourself. But it is useless to discuss  question. I am, as\\nyou say, at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction,\\nthese gentle aids to  power and honour of families, these slight\\nfavours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by\\ninterest and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are\\ngranted (comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in\\nall such things is changed for  worse. Our not remote ancestors\\nheld  right of life and death over  surrounding vulgar. From\\nthis room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in \\nnext room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on\\n spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his\\ndaughter- his daughter? We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy\\nhas become  mode; and  assertion of our station, in these\\ndays, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us\\nreal inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!\"\\n  The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\\nas elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\\ncontaining himself, that great means of regeneration.\\n  \"We have so asserted our station, both in  old time and in \\nmodern time also,\" said  nephew, gloomily, \"that I believe our name\\nto be more detested than any name in France.\"\\n  \"Let us hope so,\" said  uncle. \"Detestation of  high is \\ninvoluntary homage of  low.\"\\n  \"There is not,\" pursued  nephew, in his former tone, \"a face I\\ncan look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me\\nwith any deference on it but  dark deference of fear and slavery.\"\\n  \"A compliment,\" said  Marquis, \"to  grandeur of  family,\\nmerited by  manner in which  family has sustained its\\ngrandeur. Hah!\" And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff,\\nand lightly crossed his legs.\\n  But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on  table, covered his\\neyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand,  fine mask looked\\nat him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness,\\ncloseness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer\\'s\\nassumption of indifference.\\n  \"Repression is  only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of\\nfear and slavery, my friend,\" observed  Marquis, \"will keep \\ndogs obedient to  whip, as long as this roof,\" looking up to it,\\n\"shuts out  sky.\"\\n  That might not be so long as  Marquis supposed. If a picture of\\n chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty\\nlike it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been\\nshown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own\\nfrom  ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked ruins. As for  roof\\nhe vaunted, he might have found that shutting out  sky in a new\\nway- to wit, for ever, from  eyes of  bodies into which its lead\\nwas fired, out of  barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\\n  \"Meanwhile,\" said  Marquis, \"I will preserve  honour and\\nrepose of  family. if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall\\nwe terminate our conference for  night?\"\\n  \"A moment more.\"\\n  \"An hour, if you please.\"\\n  \"Sir,\" said  nephew, \"we have done wrong, and are reaping \\nfruits of wrong.\"\\n  \"We have done wrong?\" repeated  Marquis, with an inquiring smile,\\nand delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.\\n  \"Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much\\naccount to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father\\'s\\ntime, we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who\\ncame between us and our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of\\nmy father\\'s time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father\\'s\\ntwin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?\"\\n  \"Death has done that!\" said  Marquis.\\n  \"And has left me,\" answered  nephew, \"bound to a system that is\\nfrightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to\\nexecute  last request of my dear mother\\'s lips, and obey  last\\nlook of my dear mother\\'s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and\\nto redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.\"\\n  \"Seeking them from me, my nephew,\" said  Marquis, touching him on\\n breast with his forefinger- they were now standing by \\nhearth- \"you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.\"\\n  Every fine straight line in  clear whiteness of his face, was\\ncruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking\\nquietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he\\ntouched him on  breast, as though his finger were  fine point of\\na small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through \\nbody, and said,\\n  \"My friend, I will die, perpetuating  system under which I have\\nlived.\"\\n  When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put\\nhis box in his pocket.\\n  \"Better to be a rational creature,\" he added then, after ringing a\\nsmall bell on  table, \"and accept your natural destiny. But you are\\nlost, Monsieur Charles, I see.\"\\n  \"This property and France are lost to me,\" said  nephew, sadly;\\n\"I renounce them.\"\\n  \"Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is \\nproperty? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?\"\\n  \"I had no intention, in  words I used, to claim it yet. If it\\npassed to me from you, to-morrow--\"\\n  \"Which I have  vanity to hope is not probable.\"\\n  \"-or twenty years hence--\"\\n  \"You do me too much honour,\" said  Marquis; \"still, I prefer that\\nsupposition.\"\\n  \"-I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little\\nto relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!\"\\n  \"Hah!\" said  Marquis, glancing round  luxurious room.\\n  \"To  eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,\\nunder  sky, and by  daylight, it is a crumbling tower of\\nwaste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger,\\nnakedness, and suffering.\"\\n  \"Hah!\" said  Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.\\n  \"If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better\\nqualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from \\nweight that drags it down, so that  miserable people who cannot\\nleave it and who have been long wrung to  last point of\\nendurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not\\nfor me. There is a curse on it, and on all this land.\"\\n  \"And you?\" said  uncle. \"Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your\\nnew philosophy, graciously intend to live?\"\\n  \"I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with\\nnobility at their backs, may have to do some day- work.\"\\n  \"In England, for example?\"\\n  \"Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The\\nfamily name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no\\nother.\"\\n  The ringing of  bell had caused  adjoining bed-chamber to be\\nlighted. It now shone brightly, through  door of communication. The\\nMarquis looked that way, and listened for  retreating step of his\\nvalet.\\n  \"England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you\\nhave prospered there,\" he observed then, turning his calm face to\\nhis nephew with a smile.\\n  \"I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible\\nI may be indebted to you, sir. For  rest, it is my Refuge.\"\\n  \"They say, those boastful English, that it is  Refuge of many.\\nYou know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"With a daughter?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said  Marquis. \"You are fatigued. Good night!\"\\n  As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a\\nsecrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to\\nthose words, which struck  eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At\\n same time,  thin straight lines of  setting of  eyes, and\\n thin straight lips, and  markings in  nose, curved with a\\nsarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.\\n  \"Yes,\" repeated  Marquis. \"A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So\\ncommences  new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\"\\n  It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face\\noutside  chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew\\nlooked at him, in vain, in passing on to  door.\\n  \"Good night!\" said  uncle. \"I look to  pleasure of seeing\\nyou again in  morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his\\nchamber there!- And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you\\nwill,\" he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again,\\nand summoned his valet to his own bedroom.\\n  The valet come and gone, Monsieur  Marquis walked to and fro in\\nhis loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that\\nhot still night. Rustling about  room, his softly-slippered feet\\nmaking no noise on  floor, he moved like a refined tiger:- looked\\nlike some enchanted marquis of  impenitently wicked sort, in story,\\nwhose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off,\\nor just coming on.\\n  He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at\\n scraps of  day\\'s journey that came unbidden into his mind;\\n slow toil up  hill at sunset,  setting sun,  descent, \\nmill,  prison on  crag,  little village in  hollow, \\npeasants at  fountain, and  mender of roads with his blue cap\\npointing out  chain under  carriage. That fountain suggested \\nParis fountain,  little bundle lying on  step,  women bending\\nover it, and  tall man with his arms up, crying, \"Dead!\"\\n  \"I am cool now,\" said Monsieur  Marquis, \"and may go to bed.\"\\n  So, leaving only one light burning on  large hearth, he let his\\nthin gauze curtains fall around him, and heard  night break its\\nsilence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.\\n  The stone faces on  outer walls stared blindly at  black night\\nfor three heavy hours; for three heavy hours,  horses in \\nstables rattled at their racks,  dogs barked, and  owl made a\\nnoise with very little resemblance in it to  noise conventionally\\nassigned to  owl by men-poets. But it is  obstinate custom of\\nsuch creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them.\\n  For three heavy hours,  stone faces of  chateau, lion and\\nhuman, stared blindly at  night. Dead darkness lay on all \\nlandscape, dead darkness added its own hush to  hushing dust on all\\n roads. The burial-place had got to  pass that its little\\nheaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; \\nfigure on  Cross might have come down, for anything that could be\\nseen of it. In  village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep.\\nDreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as  starved usually do, and of ease\\nand rest, as  driven slave and  yoked ox may, its lean\\ninhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.\\n  The fountain in  village flowed unseen and unheard, and \\nfountain at  chateau dropped unseen and unheard- both melting away,\\nlike  minutes that were falling from  spring of Time- through\\nthree dark hours. Then,  grey water of both began to be ghostly\\nin  light, and  eyes of  stone faces of  chateau were\\nopened.\\n  Lighter and lighter, until at last  sun touched  tops of \\nstill trees, and poured its radiance over  hill. In  glow, \\nwater of  chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and  stone\\nfaces crimsoned. The carol of  birds was loud and high, and, on \\nweather-beaten sill of  great window of  bed-chamber of Monsieur\\n Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its\\nmight. At this,  nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and,\\nwith open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.\\n  Now,  sun was full up, and movement began in  village.\\nCasement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came\\nforth shivering- chilled, as yet, by  new sweet air. Then began \\nrarely lightened toil of  day among  village population. Some,\\nto  fountain; some, to  fields; men and women here, to dig and\\ndelve; men and women there, to see to  poor live stock, and lead\\n bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by \\nroadside. In  church and at  Cross, a kneeling figure or two;\\nattendant on  latter prayers,  led cow, trying for a breakfast\\namong  weeds at its foot.\\n  The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke\\ngradually and surely. First,  lonely boar-spears and knives of\\n chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant\\nin  morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open,\\nhorses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at  light\\nand freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at\\niron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared\\nimpatient to be loosed.\\n  All these trivial incidents belonged to  routine of life, and \\nreturn of morning. Surely, not so  ringing of  great bell of \\nchateau, nor  running up and down  stairs; nor  hurried\\nfigures on  terrace; nor  booting and tramping here and there\\nand everywhere, nor  quick saddling of horses and riding away?\\n  What winds conveyed this hurry to  grizzled mender of roads,\\nalready at work on  hill-top beyond  village, with his day\\'s\\ndinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no\\ncrow\\'s while to peck at, on a heap of stones? Had  birds,\\ncarrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they\\nsow chance seeds? Whether or no,  mender of roads ran, on \\nsultry morning, as if for his life, down  hill, knee-high in\\ndust, and never stopped till he got to  fountain.\\n  All  people of  village were at  fountain, standing about\\nin their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other\\nemotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily\\nbrought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking\\nstupidly on, or lying down chewing  cud of nothing particularly\\nrepaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their\\ninterrupted saunter. Some of  people of  chateau, and some of\\nthose of  posting-house, and all  taxing authorities, were armed\\nmore or less, and were crowded on  other side of  little\\nstreet in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing.\\nAlready,  mender of roads had penetrated into  midst of a\\ngroup of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in \\nbreast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what\\nportended  swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant\\non horseback, and  conveying away of  said Gabelle (double-laden\\nthough  horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of  German\\nballad of Leonora?\\n  It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at \\nchateau.\\n  The Gorgon had surveyed  building again in  night, and had\\nadded  one stone face wanting;  stone face for which it had\\nwaited through about two hundred years.\\n  It lay back on  pillow of Monsieur  Marquis. It was like a\\nfine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home\\ninto  heart of  stone figure attached to it, was a knife.\\nRound its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:\\n  \"Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from JACQUES.\"\\n  X\\n  TWO PROMISES\\n\\n  MORE MONTHS, to  number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr.\\nCharles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of \\nFrench language who was conversant with French literature. In this\\nage, he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He\\nread with young men who could find any leisure and interest for \\nstudy of a living tongue spoken all over  world, and he\\ncultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could\\nwrite of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound\\nEnglish. Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that\\nhad been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of  Teacher\\nclass, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson\\'s ledgers, to\\nturn cooks and carpenters. As a tutor, whose attainments made \\nstudent\\'s way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant\\ntranslator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary\\nknowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. He was\\nwell acquainted, moreover, with  circumstances of his country,\\nand those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great perseverance\\nand untiring industry, he prospered.\\n  In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor\\nto lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation,\\nhe would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found\\nit, and did it and made  best of it. In this, his prosperity\\nconsisted.\\n  A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he read\\nwith undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a\\ncontraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and\\nLatin through  Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in\\nLondon.\\n  Now, from  days when it was always summer in Eden, to these\\ndays when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes,  world of a\\nman has invariably gone one way- Charles Darnay\\'s way-  way of\\n love of a woman.\\n  He had loved Lucie Manette from  hour of his danger. He had never\\nheard a sound so sweet and dear as  sound of her compassionate\\nvoice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it\\nwas confronted with his own on  edge of  grave that had been dug\\nfor him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on  subject; \\nassassination at  deserted chateau far away beyond  heaving\\nwater and  long, long, dusty roads-  solid stone chateau which\\nhad itself become  mere mist of a dream- had been done a year,\\nand he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to\\nher  state of his heart.\\n  That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again\\na summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college\\noccupation, he turned into  quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking\\nan opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was  close\\nof  summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.\\n  He found  Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy\\nwhich had at once supported him under his old sufferings and\\naggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was\\nnow a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose,\\nstrength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered\\nenergy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first\\nbeen in  exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had\\nnever been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.\\n  He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue\\nwith ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles\\nDarnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.\\n  \"Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your\\nreturn these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton\\nwere both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\"\\n  \"I am obliged to them for their interest in  matter,\" he\\nanswered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to \\nDoctor. \"Miss Manette--\"\\n  \"Is well,\" said  Doctor, as he stopped short, \"and your return\\nwill delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but\\nwill soon be home.\"\\n  \"Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took  opportunity of\\nher being from home, to beg to speak to you.\"\\n  There was a blank silence.\\n  \"Yes?\" said  Doctor, with evident constraint. \"Bring your chair\\nhere, and speak on.\"\\n  He complied as to  chair, but appeared to find  speaking on\\nless easy.\\n  \"I have had  happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate\\nhere,\" so he at length began, \"for some year and a half, that I hope\\n topic on which I am about to touch may not--\"\\n  He was stayed by  Doctor\\'s putting out his hand to stop him. When\\nhe had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:\\n  \"Is Lucie  topic?\"\\n  \"She is.\"\\n  \"It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard\\nfor me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\"\\n  \"It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love,\\nDoctor Manette!\" he said deferentially.\\n  There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:\\n  \"I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\"\\n  His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it\\noriginated in an unwillingness to approach  subject, that Charles\\nDarnay hesitated.\\n  \"Shall I go on, sir?\"\\n  Another blank.\\n  \"Yes, go on.\"\\n  \"You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how\\nearnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret\\nheart, and  hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long\\nbeen laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly,\\ndearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in \\nworld, I love her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak\\nfor me!\"\\n  The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on \\nground. At  last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,\\nand cried:\\n  \"Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\"\\n  His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles\\nDarnay\\'s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with  hand he\\nhad extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The\\nlatter so received it, and remained silent.\\n  \"I ask your pardon,\" said  Doctor, in a subdued tone, after\\nsome moments. \"I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be\\nsatisfied of it.\"\\n  He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or\\nraise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair\\novershadowed his face:\\n  \"Have you spoken to Lucie?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  \"Nor written?\"\\n  \"Never.\"\\n  \"It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your\\nself-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father.\\nHer father thanks you.\"\\n  He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.\\n  \"I know,\" said Darnay, respectfully, \"how can I fail to know, Doctor\\nManette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between\\nyou and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so\\nbelonging to  circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that\\nit can have few parallels, even in  tenderness between a father and\\nchild. I know, Doctor Manette- how can I fail to know- that, mingled\\nwith  affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman,\\nthere is, in her heart, towards you, all  love and reliance of\\ninfancy itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so\\nshe is now devoted to you with all  constancy and fervour of her\\npresent years and character, united to  trustfulness and attachment\\nof  early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well\\nthat if you had been restored to her from  world beyond this\\nlife, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred\\ncharacter than that in which you are always with her. I know that when\\nshe is clinging to you,  hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in\\none, are round your neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves\\nher mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her\\nmother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in\\nyour blessed restoration. I have known this, night and day, since I\\nhave known you in your home.\"\\n  Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was\\na little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.\\n  \"Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you\\nwith this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne,\\nas long as it was in  nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do\\neven now feel, that to bring my love- even mine- between you, is to\\ntouch your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I\\nlove her. Heaven is my witness that I love her!\"\\n  \"I believe it,\" answered her father, mournfully. \"I have thought\\nso before now. I believe it.\"\\n  \"But, do not believe,\" said Darnay, upon whose ear  mournful\\nvoice struck with a reproachful sound, \"that if my fortune were so\\ncast as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at\\nany time put any separation between her and you, I could or would\\nbreathe a word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to\\nbe hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such\\npossibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my\\nthoughts, and hidden in my heart- if it ever had been there- if it\\never could be there- I could not now touch this honoured hand.\"\\n  He laid his own upon it as he spoke.\\n  \"No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France;\\nlike you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and\\nmiseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions,\\nand trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your\\nfortunes, sharing your Life and home, and being faithful to you to \\ndeath. Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child,\\ncompanion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer\\nto you, if such a thing can be.\"\\n  His touch still lingered on her father\\'s hand. Answering  touch\\nfor a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon \\narms of his chair, and looked up for  first time since \\nbeginning of  conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a\\nstruggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to\\ndark doubt and dread.\\n  \"You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I\\nthank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart- or nearly so.\\nHave you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?\"\\n  \"None. As yet, none.\"\\n  \"Is it  immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once\\nascertain that, with my knowledge?\"\\n  \"Not even so. I might not have  hopefulness to do it for weeks; I\\nmight (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.\"\\n  \"Do you seek any guidance from me?\"\\n  \"I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have\\nit in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\"\\n  \"Do you seek any promise from me?\"\\n  \"I do seek that.\"\\n  \"What is it?\"\\n  \"I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well\\nunderstand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her\\ninnocent heart- do not think I have  presumption to assume so much-\\nI could retain no place in it against her love for her father.\"\\n  \"If that be so, do you see what, on  other hand, is involved in\\nit?\"\\n  \"I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any\\nsuitor\\'s favour, would outweigh herself and all  world. For which\\nreason, Doctor Manette,\" said Darnay, modestly but firmly, \"I would\\nnot ask that word, to save my life.\"\\n  \"I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love,\\nas well as out of wide division; in  former case, they are subtle\\nand delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in\\nthis one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at \\nstate of her heart.\"\\n  \"May I ask, sir, if you think she is--\" As he hesitated, her\\nfather supplied  rest.\\n  \"Is sought by any other suitor?\"\\n  \"It is what I meant to say.\"\\n  Her father considered a Little before he answered:\\n  \"You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,\\noccasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\"\\n  \"Or both,\" said Darnay.\\n  \"I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You\\nwant a promise from me. Tell me what it is.\"\\n  \"It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her\\nown part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you,\\nyou will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it.\\nI hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence\\nagainst me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I\\nask. The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an\\nundoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.\"\\n  \"I give  promise,\" said  Doctor, \"without any condition. I\\nbelieve your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated\\nit. I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken,\\n ties between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should\\never tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will\\ngive her to you. If there were- Charles Darnay, if there were--\"\\n  The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their bands were joined\\nas  Doctor spoke:\\n  \"-any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything\\nwhatsoever, new or old, against  man she really loved-  direct\\nresponsibility thereof not lying on his head- they should all be\\nobliterated for her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than\\nsuffering, more to me than wrong, more to me-- Well! This is idle\\ntalk.\"\\n  So strange was  way in which he faded into silence, and so\\nstrange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt\\nhis own hand turn cold in  hand that slowly released and dropped\\nit.\\n  \"You said something to me,\" said Doctor Manette, breaking into a\\nsmile. \"What was it you said to me?\"\\n  He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of\\na condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:\\n  \"Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence\\non my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my\\nmother\\'s, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you\\nwhat that is, and why I am in England.\"\\n  \"Stop!\" said  Doctor of Beauvais.\\n  \"I wish it, that I may  better deserve your confidence, and\\nhave no secret from you.\"\\n  \"Stop!\"\\n  For an instant,  Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for\\nanother instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay\\'s lips.\\n  \"Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if\\nLucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning.\\nDo you promise?\"\\n  \"Willingly.\"\\n  \"Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better\\nshe should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!\"\\n  It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later\\nand darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into  room alone-\\nfor Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs- and was surprised to\\nfind his reading-chair empty.\\n  \"My father!\" she called to him. \"Father dear!\"\\n  Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in\\nhis bedroom. Passing lightly across  intermediate room, she\\nlooked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to\\nherself, with her blood all chilled, \"What shall I do! What shall I\\ndo!\"\\n  Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at\\nhis door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at  sound of\\nher voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and\\ndown together for a long time.\\n  She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that\\nnight. He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old\\nunfinished work, were all as usual.\\n  XI\\n  A COMPANION PICTURE\\n\\n  \"SYDNEY,\" said Mr. Stryver, on that selfsame night, or morning, to\\nhis jackal; \"mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to\\nyou.\"\\n  Sydney had been working double tides that night, and  night\\nbefore, and  night before that, and a good many nights in\\nsuccession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver\\'s papers before\\n setting in of  long vacation. The clearance was effected at\\nlast;  Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was\\ngot rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric and\\nfogs legal, and bring grist to  mill again.\\n  Sydney was none  livelier and none  soberer for so much\\napplication. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him\\nthrough  night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had\\npreceded  towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as\\nhe now pulled his turban off and threw it into  basin in which he\\nhad steeped it at intervals for  last six hours.\\n  \"Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?\" said Stryver \\nportly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from \\nsofa where he lay on his back.\\n  \"I am.\"\\n  \"Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather\\nsurprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as\\nshrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.\"\\n  \"Do you?\"\\n  \"Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?\"\\n  \"Guess.\"\\n  \"Do I know her?\"\\n  \"Guess.\"\\n  \"I am not going to guess, at five o\\'clock in  morning, with my\\nbrains frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess,\\nyou must ask me to dinner.\"\\n  \"Well then, I\\'ll tell you,\" said Stryver, coming slowly into a\\nsitting posture. \"Sydney, I rather despair of making myself\\nintelligible to you, because you are such an insensible dog.\"\\n  \"And you,\" returned Sydney, busy concocting  punch, \"are such a\\nsensitive and poetical spirit.\"\\n  \"Come!\" rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, \"though I don\\'t\\nprefer any claim to being  soul of Romance (for I hope I know\\nbetter), still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than you.\"\\n  \"You are a luckier, if you mean that.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t mean that. I mean I am a man of more- more--\"\\n  \"Say gallantry, while you are about it,\" suggested Carton.\\n  \"Well! I\\'ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,\" said\\nStryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made  punch, \"who\\ncares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable,\\nwho knows better how to be agreeable, in a woman\\'s society, than you\\ndo.\"\\n  \"Go on,\" said Sydney Carton.\\n  \"No; but before I go on,\" said Stryver, shaking his head in his\\nbullying way, \"I\\'ll have this out with you. You\\'ve been at Doctor\\nManette\\'s house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have\\nbeen ashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of\\nthat silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and\\nsoul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!\"\\n  \"It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at \\nbar, to be ashamed of anything,\" returned Sydney; \"you ought to be\\nmuch obliged to me.\"\\n  \"You shall not get off in that way,\" rejoined Stryver, shouldering\\n rejoinder at him; \"no, Sydney, it\\'s my duty to tell you- and I\\ntell you to your face to do you good-that you are a de-vilish\\nill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable\\nfellow.\"\\n  Sydney drank a bumper of  punch he had made, and laughed.\\n  \"Look at me!\" said Stryver, squaring himself; \"I have less need to\\nmake myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in\\ncircumstances. Why do I do it?\"\\n  \"I never saw you do it yet,\" muttered Carton.\\n  \"I do it because it\\'s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me!\\nI get on.\"\\n  \"You don\\'t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,\"\\nanswered Carton, with a careless air; \"I wish you would keep to\\nthat. As to me- will you never understand that I am incorrigible?\"\\n  He asked  question with some appearance of scorn.\\n  \"You have no business to be incorrigible,\" was his friend\\'s\\nanswer, delivered in no very soothing tone.\\n  \"I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,\" said Sydney\\nCarton. \"Who is  lady?\"\\n  \"Now, don\\'t let my announcement of  name make you\\nuncomfortable, Sydney,\" said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with\\nostentatious friendliness for  disclosure he was about to make,\\n\"because I know you don\\'t mean half you say; and if you meant it\\nall, it would be of no importance. I make this little preface, because\\nyou once mentioned  young lady to me in slighting terms.\"\\n  \"I did?\"\\n  \"Certainly; and in these chambers.\"\\n  Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent\\nfriend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.\\n  \"You made mention of  young lady as a golden-haired doll. The\\nyoung lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any\\nsensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I\\nmight have been a little resentful of your employing such a\\ndesignation; but you are not. You want that sense altogether;\\ntherefore I am no more annoyed when I think of  expression, than\\nI should be annoyed by a man\\'s opinion of a picture of mine, who had\\nno eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear\\nfor music.\"\\n  Sydney Carton drank  punch at a great rate; drank it by\\nbumpers, looking at his friend.\\n  \"Now you know all about it, Syd,\" said Mr. Stryver. \"I don\\'t care\\nabout fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my\\nmind to please myself: on  whole, I think I can afford to please\\nmyself. She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a\\nrapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of\\ngood fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you\\nastonished?\"\\n  Carton, still drinking  punch, rejoined, \"Why should I be\\nastonished?\"\\n  \"You approve?\"\\n  Carton, still drinking  punch, rejoined, \"Why should I not\\napprove?\"\\n  \"Well!\" said his friend Stryver, \"you take it more easily than I\\nfancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I\\nthought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this\\ntime that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes,\\nSydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a\\nchange from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a\\nhome when he feels inclined to go to it (when he doesn\\'t, he can\\nstay away), and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any\\nstation, and will always do me credit. So I have made up my mind.\\nAnd now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to you about your\\nprospects. You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad\\nway. You don\\'t know  value of money, you live hard, you\\'ll knock up\\none of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think\\nabout a nurse.\"\\n  The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look\\ntwice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.\\n  \"Now, let me recommend you,\" pursued Stryver, \"to look it in \\nface. I have looked it in  face, in my different way; look it in\\n face, you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to\\ntake care of you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women\\'s\\nsociety, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out\\nsomebody. Find out some respectable woman with a little property-\\nsomebody in  landlady way, or lodging-letting way- and marry her,\\nagainst a rainy day. That\\'s  kind of thing for you. Now think of\\nit, Sydney.\"\\n  \"I\\'ll think of it,\" said Sydney.\\n  XII\\n  THE FELLOW OF DELICACY\\n\\n  MR. STRYVER having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal\\nof good fortune on  Doctor\\'s daughter, resolved to make her\\nhappiness known to her before he left town for  Long Vacation.\\nAfter some mental debating of  point, he came to  conclusion\\nthat it would be as well to get all  preliminaries done with, and\\nthey could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her\\nhis hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term, or in  little\\nChristmas vacation between it and Hilary.\\n  As to  strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but\\nclearly saw his way to  verdict. Argued with  jury on\\nsubstantial worldly grounds-  only grounds ever worth taking into\\naccount-it was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He\\ncalled himself for  plaintiff, there was no getting over his\\nevidence,  counsel for  defendant threw up his brief, and \\njury did not even turn to consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J.,\\nwas satisfied that no plainer case could be.\\n  Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated  Long Vacation with a formal\\nproposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to\\nRanelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it beloved him to present\\nhimself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.\\n  Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from \\nTemple, while  bloom of  Long Vacation\\'s infancy was still\\nupon it. Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while\\nhe was yet on Saint Dunstan\\'s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his\\nfull-blown way along  pavement, to  jostlement of all weaker\\npeople, might have seen how safe and strong he was.\\n  His way taking him past Tellson\\'s, and he both banking at\\nTellson\\'s and knowing Mr. Lorry as  intimate friend of \\nManettes, it entered Mr. Stryver\\'s mind to enter  bank, and\\nreveal to Mr. Lorry  brightness of  Soho horizon. So, be\\npushed open  door with  weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down\\n two steps, got past  two ancient cashiers, and shouldered\\nhimself into  musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great\\nbooks ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his window as\\nif that were ruled for figures too, and everything under  clouds\\nwere a sum.\\n  \"Halloa!\" said Mr. Stryver. \"How do you do? I hope you are well!\"\\n  It was Stryver\\'s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for\\nany place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson\\'s, that old\\nclerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as\\nthough he squeezed them against  wall. The House itself,\\nmagnificently reading  paper quite in  far-off perspective,\\nlowered displeased, as if  Stryver head had been butted into its\\nresponsible waistcoat.\\n  The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of  voice he\\nwould recommend under  circumstances, \"How do you do, Mr.\\nStryver? How do you do, sir?\" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity\\nin his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at\\nTellson\\'s who shook hands with a customer when  House pervaded\\n air. He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for\\nTellson and Co.\\n  \"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\" asked Mr. Lorry, in his\\nbusiness character.\\n  \"Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry;\\nI have come for a private word.\"\\n  \"Oh indeed!\" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye\\nstrayed to  House afar off.\\n  \"I am going,\" said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on\\n desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there\\nappeared to be not half desk enough for him: \"I am going to make an\\noffer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss\\nManette, Mr. Lorry.\"\\n  \"Oh dear me!\" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at\\nhis visitor dubiously.\\n  \"Oh dear me, sir?\" repeated Stryver, drawing back. \"Oh dear you,\\nsir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\"\\n  \"My meaning,\" answered  man of business, \"is, of course, friendly\\nand appreciative, and that it does you  greatest credit, and- in\\nshort, my meaning is everything you could desire. But- really, you\\nknow, Mr. Stryver--\" Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in\\n oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add,\\ninternally, \"you know there really is so much too much of you!\"\\n  \"Well!\" said Stryver, slapping  desk with his contentious hand,\\nopening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \"if I understand\\nyou, Mr. Lorry, I\\'ll be hanged!\"\\n  Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards\\nthat end, and bit  feather of a pen.\\n  \"D-n it all, sir!\" said Stryver, staring at him, \"am I not\\neligible?\"\\n  \"Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you\\'re eligible!\" said Mr. Lorry. \"If you\\nsay eligible, you are eligible.\"\\n  \"Am I not prosperous?\" asked Stryver.\\n  \"Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"And advancing?\"\\n  \"If you come to advancing you know,\" said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be\\nable to make another admission, \"nobody can doubt that.\"\\n  \"Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\" demanded Stryver,\\nperceptibly crestfallen.\\n  \"Well! I-- Were you going there now?\" asked Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"Straight!\" said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on  desk.\\n  \"Then I think I wouldn\\'t, if I was you.\"\\n  \"Why?\" said Stryver. \"Now, I\\'ll put you in a corner,\" forensically\\nshaking a forefinger at him. \"You are a man of business and bound to\\nhave a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn\\'t you go?\"\\n  \"Because,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"I wouldn\\'t go on such an object\\nwithout having some cause to believe that I should succeed.\"\\n  \"D-n ME!\" Cried Stryver, \"but this beats everything.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry glanced at  distant House, and glanced at  angry\\nStryver.\\n  \"Here\\'s a man of business- a man of years- a man of experience- in a\\nBank,\" said Stryver; \"and having summed up three leading reasons for\\ncomplete success, he says there\\'s no reason at all! Says it with his\\nhead on!\" Mr. Stryver remarked upon  peculiarity as if it would\\nhave been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head\\noff.\\n  \"When I speak of success, I speak of success with  young lady;\\nand when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I\\nspeak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with  young\\nlady. The young lady, my good sir,\" said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping \\nStryver arm, \" young lady. The young lady goes before all.\"\\n  \"Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,\" said Stryver, squaring his\\nelbows, \"that it is your deliberate opinion that  young lady at\\npresent in question is a mincing Fool?\"\\n  \"Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\" said Mr. Lorry,\\nreddening, \"that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young\\nlady from any lips; and that if I knew any man- which I hope I do not-\\nwhose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that\\nhe could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that\\nyoung lady at this desk, not even Tellson\\'s should prevent my giving\\nhim a piece of my mind.\"\\n  The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr.\\nStryver\\'s blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to\\nbe angry; Mr. Lorry\\'s veins, methodical as their courses could usually\\nbe, were in no better state now it was his turn.\\n  \"That is what I mean to tell you, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Pray let\\nthere be no mistake about it.\"\\n  Mr. Stryver sucked  end of a ruler for a little while, and then\\nstood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him\\n toothache. He broke  awkward silence by saying:\\n  \"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise\\nme not to go up to Soho and offer myself- myself, Stryver of \\nKing\\'s Bench bar?\"\\n  \"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\"\\n  \"Yes, I do.\"\\n  \"Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\"\\n  \"And all I can say of it is,\" laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh,\\n\"that this- ha, ha!- beats everything past, present, and to come.\"\\n  \"Now understand me,\" pursued Mr. Lorry. \"As a man of business, I\\nam not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man\\nof business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has\\ncarried Miss Manette in his arms, who is  trusted friend of Miss\\nManette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for\\nthem both, I have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking,\\nrecollect. Now, you think I may not be right?\"\\n  \"Not I!\" said Stryver, whistling. \"I can\\'t undertake to find third\\nparties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose\\nsense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter\\nnonsense. It\\'s new to me, but you are right, I dare say.\"\\n  \"What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself.\\nAnd understand me, sir,\" said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \"I\\nwill not- not even at Tellson\\'s- have it characterised for me by any\\ngentleman breathing.\"\\n  \"There! I beg your pardon!\" said Stryver.\\n  \"Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:- it\\nmight be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful\\nto Doctor Manette to have  task of being explicit with you, it\\nmight be very painful to Miss Manette to have  task of being\\nexplicit with you. You know  terms upon which I have  honour and\\nhappiness to stand with  family. If you please, committing you in\\nno way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my\\nadvice by  exercise of a little new observation and judgment\\nexpressly brought to bear upon it. If you should then be\\ndissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if,\\non  other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be\\nwhat it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared. What do\\nyou say?\"\\n  \"How long would you keep me in town?\"\\n  \"Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in \\nevening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\"\\n  \"Then I say yes,\" said Stryver: \"I won\\'t go up there now, I am not\\nso hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you\\nto look in to-night. Good morning.\"\\n  Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of  Bank, causing such a\\nconcussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against\\nit bowing behind  two counters, required  utmost remaining\\nstrength of  two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons\\nwere always seen by  public in  act of bowing, and were\\npopularly believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to\\nkeep on bowing in  empty office until they bowed another customer\\nin.\\n  The barrister was keen enough to divine that  banker would not\\nhave gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground\\nthan moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for  large pill he had\\nto swallow, he got it down. \"And now,\" said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\\nforensic forefinger at  Temple in general, when it was down, \"my\\nway out of this, is, to put you all in  wrong.\"\\n  It was a bit of  art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which be\\nfound great relief. \"You shall not put me in  wrong, young lady,\"\\nsaid Mr. Stryver; \"I\\'ll do that for you.\"\\n  Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten\\no\\'clock, Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered\\nout for  purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than\\n subject of  morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr.\\nLorry, and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\\n  \"Well!\" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\\nbootless attempts to bring him round to  question. \"I have been\\nto Soho.\"\\n  \"To Soho?\" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. \"Oh, to be sure! What am\\nI thinking of!\"\\n  \"And I have no doubt,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was right in \\nconversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my\\nadvice.\"\\n  \"I assure you,\" returned Mr. Stryver, in  friendliest way,\\n\"that I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on \\npoor father\\'s account. I know this must always be a sore subject\\nwith  family; let us say no more about it.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t understand you,\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"I dare say not,\" rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a\\nsmoothing and final way; \"no matter, no matter.\"\\n  \"But it does matter,\" Mr. Lorry urged.\\n  \"No it doesn\\'t; I assure you it doesn\\'t. Having supposed that\\nthere was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where\\nthere is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and\\nno harm is done. Young women have committed similar follies often\\nbefore, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often\\nbefore. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that  thing is\\ndropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly\\npoint of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that  thing has\\ndropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly\\npoint of view- it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained\\nnothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not proposed to\\n young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on\\nreflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent.\\nMr. Lorry, you cannot control  mincing vanities and giddinesses\\nof empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will\\nalways be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,\\nI regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own\\naccount. And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to\\nsound you, and for giving me your advice; you know  young lady\\nbetter than I do; you were right, it never would have done.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.\\nStryver shouldering him towards  door, with an appearance of\\nshowering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.\\n\"Make  best of it, my dear sir,\" said Stryver; \"say no more about\\nit; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!\"\\n  Mr. Lorry was out in  night, before he knew where he was. Mr.\\nStryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.\\n  XIII\\n  THE FELLOW OF NO DELICACY\\n\\n  IF SYDNEY CARTON ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in\\n house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole\\nyear, and had always been  same moody and morose lounger there.\\nWhen he cared to talk, he talked well; but,  cloud of caring for\\nnothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very\\nrarely pierced by  light within him.\\n  And yet he did care something for  streets that environed that\\nhouse, and for  senseless stones that made their pavements. Many\\na night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought\\nno transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his\\nsolitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when \\nfirst beams of  sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of\\narchitecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps \\nquiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and\\nunattainable, into his mind. Of late,  neglected bed in \\nTemple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when\\nhe had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got\\nup again, and haunted that neighbourhood.\\n  On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his\\njackal that \"he had thought better of that marrying matter\") had\\ncarried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when  sight and scent\\nof flowers in  City streets had some waifs of goodness in them\\nfor  worst, of health for  sickliest, and of youth for \\noldest, Sydney\\'s feet still trod those stones. From being irresolute\\nand purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in \\nworking out of that intention, they took him to  Doctor\\'s door.\\n  He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She\\nhad never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with\\nsome little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But,\\nlooking up at his face in  interchange of  first few\\ncommon-places, she observed a change in it.\\n  \"I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!\"\\n  \"No. But  life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to\\nhealth. What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?\"\\n  \"Is it not- forgive me; I have begun  question on my lips- a pity\\nto live no better life?\"\\n  \"God knows it is a shame!\"\\n  \"Then why not change it?\"\\n  Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see\\nthat there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice\\ntoo, as he answered:\\n  \"It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall\\nsink lower, and be worse.\"\\n  He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand.\\nThe table trembled in  silence that followed.\\n  She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew\\nher to be so, without looking at her, and said:\\n  \"Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before  knowledge of\\nwhat I want to say to you. Will you hear me?\"\\n  \"If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you\\nhappier, it would make me very glad!\"\\n  \"God bless you for your sweet compassion!\"\\n  He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.\\n  \"Don\\'t be afraid to hear me. Don\\'t shrink from anything I say. I\\nam like one who died young. All my life might have been.\"\\n  \"No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that  best part of it might still\\nbe; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.\"\\n  \"Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better- although in\\n mystery of my own wretched heart I know better- I shall never\\nforget it!\"\\n  She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed\\ndespair of himself which made  interview unlike any other that\\ncould have been holden.\\n  \"If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned\\n love of  man you see before you- self-flung away, wasted,\\ndrunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be- he would\\nhave been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that\\nhe would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance,\\nblight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well\\nthat you can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even\\nthankful that it cannot be.\"\\n  \"Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you-\\nforgive me again!- to a better course? Can I in no way repay your\\nconfidence? I know this is a confidence,\" she modestly said, after a\\nlittle hesitation, and in earnest tears, \"I know you would say this to\\nno one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr.\\nCarton?\"\\n  He shook his head.\\n  \"To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a\\nvery little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to\\nknow that you have been  last dream of my soul. In my degradation I\\nhave not been so degraded but that  sight of you with your\\nfather, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old\\nshadows that I thought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have\\nbeen troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me\\nagain, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward,\\nthat I thought were silent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of\\nstriving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and\\nfighting out  abandoned fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in\\nnothing, and leaves  sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to\\nknow that you inspired it.\"\\n  \"Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!\"\\n  \"No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite\\nundeserving. And yet I have had  weakness, and have still \\nweakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled\\nme, heap of ashes that I am, into fire- a fire, however, inseparable\\nin its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing\\nno service, idly burning away.\"\\n  \"Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more\\nunhappy than you were before you knew me--\"\\n  \"Don\\'t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if\\nanything could. You will not be  cause of my becoming worse.\"\\n  \"Since  state of your mind that you describe, is, at all\\nevents, attributable to some influence of mine- this is what I mean,\\nif I can make it plain- can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no\\npower for good, with you, at all?\"\\n  \"The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come\\nhere to realise. Let me carry through  rest of my misdirected life,\\n remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all \\nworld; and that there was something left in me at this time which\\nyou could deplore and pity.\"\\n  \"Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most\\nfervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr.\\nCarton!\"\\n  \"Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved\\nmyself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will\\nyou let me believe, when I recall this day, that  last confidence\\nof my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it\\nlies there alone, and will be shared by no one?\"\\n  \"If that will be a consolation to you, yes.\"\\n  \"Not even by  dearest one ever to be known to you?\"\\n  \"Mr. Carton,\" she answered, after an agitated pause, \" secret\\nis yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.\"\\n  \"Thank you. And again, God bless you.\"\\n  He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards  door.\\n  \"Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this\\nconversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it\\nagain. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is\\nhenceforth. In  hour of my death, I shall hold sacred  one\\ngood remembrance- and shall thank and bless you for it- that my last\\navowal of myself was made to you, and that my name, and faults, and\\nmiseries were gently carried in your heart. May it otherwise be\\nlight and happy!\"\\n  He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so\\nsad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day\\nkept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as\\nhe stood looking back at her.\\n  \"Be comforted!\" he said, \"I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette.\\nAn hour or two hence, and  low companions and low habits that I\\nscorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those,\\nthan any wretch who creeps along  streets. Be comforted! But,\\nwithin myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though\\noutwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me. The last\\nsupplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this\\nof me.\"\\n  \"I will, Mr. Carton.\"\\n  \"My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve\\nyou of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and\\nbetween whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to\\nsay it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear\\nto you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind\\nthat there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would\\nembrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold\\nme in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this\\none thing. The time will come,  time will not be long in coming,\\nwhen new ties will be formed about you- ties that will bind you yet\\nmore tenderly and strongly to  home you so adorn-  dearest\\nties that will ever grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when \\nlittle picture of a happy father\\'s face looks up in yours, when you\\nsee your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now\\nand then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life\\nyou love beside you!\"\\n  He said, \"Farewell!\" said a last \"God bless you!\" and left her.\\n  XIV\\n  THE HONEST TRADESMAN\\n\\n  To THE EYES of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in\\nFleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and\\nvariety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit\\nupon anything in Fleet-street during  busy hours of  day, and\\nnot be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending\\nwestward with  sun,  other ever tending eastward from  sun,\\nboth ever tending to  plains beyond  range of red and purple\\nwhere  sun goes down!\\n  With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching  two\\nstreams, like  heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on\\nduty watching one stream- saving that Jerry had no expectation of\\ntheir ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a\\nhopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from \\npilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past  middle\\nterm of life) from Tellson\\'s side of  tides to  opposite\\nshore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr.\\nCruncher never failed to become so interested in  lady as to\\nexpress a strong desire to have  honour of drinking her very good\\nhealth. And it was from  gifts bestowed upon him towards \\nexecution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his\\nfinances, as just now observed.\\n  Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and\\nmused in  sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a\\npublic place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and\\nlooked about him.\\n  It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\\nfew, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so\\nunprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\\nCruncher must have been \"flopping\" in some pointed manner, when an\\nunusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his\\nattention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of\\nfuneral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this\\nfuneral, which engendered uproar.\\n  \"Young Jerry,\" said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, \"it\\'s\\na buryin\\'.\"\\n  \"Hooroar, father!\" cried Young Jerry.\\n  The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious\\nsignificance. The elder gentleman took  cry so ill, that he watched\\nhis opportunity, and smote  young gentleman on  ear.\\n  \"What d\\'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to\\nconvey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too\\nmany for me!\" said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. \"Him and his hooroars!\\nDon\\'t let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me.\\nD\\'ye hear?\"\\n  \"I warn\\'t doing no harm,\" Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.\\n  \"Drop it then,\" said Mr. Cruncher; \"I won\\'t have none of Your no\\nharms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at  crowd.\\n  His son obeyed, and  crowd approached; they were bawling and\\nhissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which\\nmourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in  dingy\\ntrappings that were considered essential to  dignity of \\nposition. The position appeared by no means to please him, however,\\nwith an increasing rabble surrounding  coach, deriding him,\\nmaking grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out:\\n\"Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!\" with many compliments too numerous and\\nforcible to repeat.\\n  Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr.\\nCruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when\\na funeral passed Tellson\\'s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with\\nthis uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of \\nfirst man who ran against him:\\n  \"What is it, brother? What\\'s it about?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know,\" said  man. \"Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!\"\\n  He asked another man. \"Who is it?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know,\" returned  man, clapping his hands to his mouth\\nnevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with \\ngreatest ardour, \"Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi-ies!\"\\n  At length, a person better informed on  merits of  case,\\ntumbled against him, and from this person he learned that \\nfuneral was  funeral of one Roger Cly.\\n  \"Was He a spy?\" asked Mr. Cruncher.\\n  \"Old Bailey spy,\" returned his informant. \"Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old\\nBailey Spi-i-ies!\"\\n  \"Why, to be sure!\" exclaimed Jerry, recalling  Trial at which\\nhe had assisted. \"I\\'ve seen him. Dead, is he?\"\\n  \"Dead as mutton,\" returned  other, \"and can\\'t be too dead. Have\\n\\'em out, there! Spies! Pull \\'em out, there! Spies!\"\\n  The idea was so acceptable in  prevalent absence of any idea,\\nthat  crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating \\nsuggestion to have \\'em out, and to pull \\'em out, mobbed  two\\nvehicles so closely that they came to a stop. On  crowd\\'s opening\\n coach doors,  one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in\\ntheir hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good\\nuse of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a\\nbye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white\\npocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.\\n  These,  people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with\\ngreat enjoyment, while  tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops;\\nfor a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster\\nmuch dreaded. They had already got  length of opening  hearse to\\ntake  coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its\\nbeing escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing.\\nPractical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was\\nreceived with acclamation, and  coach was immediately filled with\\neight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on  roof\\nof  hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it.\\nAmong  first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who\\nmodestly concealed his spiky head from  observation of Tellson\\'s,\\nin  further corner of  mourning coach.\\n  The officiating undertakers made some protest against these\\nchanges in  ceremonies; but,  river being alarmingly near. and\\nseveral voices remarking on  efficacy of cold immersion in bringing\\nrefractory members of  profession to reason,  protest was\\nfaint and brief. The remodelled procession started, with a\\nchimney-sweep driving  hearse- advised by  regular driver, who\\nwas perched beside him, under close inspection, for  purpose- and\\nwith a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving \\nmourning coach. A bear-leader, a popular street character of  time,\\nwas impressed as an additional ornament, before  cavalcade had gone\\nfar down  Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy,\\ngave quite an Undertaking air to that part of  procession in\\nwhich he walked.\\n  Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite\\ncaricaturing of woe,  disorderly procession went its way,\\nrecruiting at every step, and all  shops shutting up before it. Its\\ndestination was  old church of Saint Pancras, far off in \\nfields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into \\nburial-ground; finally, accomplished  interment of  deceased\\nRoger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction.\\n  The dead man disposed of, and  crowd being under  necessity of\\nproviding some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius\\n(or perhaps  same) conceived  humour of impeaching casual\\npassers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\\nwas given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been\\nnear  Old Bailey in their lives, in  realisation of this\\nfancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to\\n sport of window-breaking, and thence to  plundering of\\npublic-houses, was easy and natural. At last, after several hours,\\nwhen sundry summer houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings\\nhad been torn up, to arm  more belligerent spirits, a rumour got\\nabout that  Guards were coming. Before this rumour,  crowd\\ngradually melted away, and perhaps  Guards came, and perhaps they\\nnever came, and this was  usual progress of a mob.\\n  Mr. Cruncher did not assist at  closing sports, but had\\nremained behind in  churchyard, to confer and condole with \\nundertakers. The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured\\na pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in\\nat  railings and maturely considering  spot.\\n  \"Jerry,\" said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,\\n\"you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes\\nthat he was a young \\'un and a straight made \\'un.\"\\n  Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\\nhimself about, that he might appear, before  hour of closing, on\\nhis station at Tellson\\'s. Whether his meditations on mortality had\\ntouched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously\\nat all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an\\neminent man, is not so much to  purpose, as that he made a short\\ncall upon his medical adviser- a distinguished surgeon- on his way\\nback.\\n  Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and\\nreported No job in his absence. The bank closed,  ancient clerks\\ncame out,  usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went\\nhome to tea.\\n  \"Now, I tell you where it is!\" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on\\nentering. \"If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong\\nto-night, I shall make sure that you\\'ve been praying again me, and I\\nshall work you for it just  same as if I seen you do it.\"\\n  The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.\\n  \"Why, you\\'re at it afore my face!\" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs\\nof angry apprehension.\\n  \"I am saying nothing.\"\\n  \"Well, then; don\\'t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as\\nmeditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it\\naltogether.\"\\n  \"Yes, Jerry.\"\\n  \"Yes, Jerry,\" repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. \"Ah! It\\nis yes, Jerry. That\\'s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky\\ncorroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do,\\nto express general ironical dissatisfaction.\\n  \"You and your yes, Jerry,\" said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of\\nhis bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large\\ninvisible oyster out of his saucer. \"Ah! I think so. I believe you.\"\\n  \"You are going out to-night?\" asked his decent wife, when he took\\nanother bite.\\n  \"Yes, I am.\"\\n  \"May I go with you, father?\" asked his son, briskly.\\n  \"No, you mayn\\'t. I\\'m a going- as your mother knows- a fishing.\\nThat\\'s where I\\'m going to. Going a fishing.\"\\n  \"Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don\\'t it, father?\"\\n  \"Never you mind.\"\\n  \"Shall you bring any fish home, father?\"\\n  \"If I don\\'t, you\\'ll have short commons, to-morrow,\" returned that\\ngentleman, shaking his head; \"that\\'s questions enough for you; I ain\\'t\\na going out, till you\\'ve been long abed.\"\\n  He devoted himself during  remainder of  evening to keeping\\na most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in\\nconversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions\\nto his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in\\nconversation also, and led  unfortunate woman a hard life by\\ndwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather\\nthan he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The\\ndevoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to  efficacy\\nof an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was\\nas if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost\\nstory.\\n  \"And mind you!\" said Mr. Cruncher. \"No games to-morrow! If I, as a\\nhonest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of\\nyour not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest\\ntradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on\\nwater. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly\\ncustomer to you, if you don\\'t. I\\'m your Rome, you know.\"\\n  Then he began grumbling again:\\n  \"With your flying into  face of your own wittles and drink! I\\ndon\\'t know how scarce you mayn\\'t make  wittles and drink here, by\\nyour flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy:\\nhe is your\\'n, ain\\'t he? He\\'s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a\\nmother, and not know that a mother\\'s first duty is to blow her boy\\nout?\"\\n  This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother\\nto perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected,\\nabove all things to lay especial stress on  discharge of that\\nmaternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other\\nparent.\\n  Thus  evening wore away with  Cruncher family, until Young\\nJerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar\\ninjunctions, obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled  earlier watches of\\n night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion\\nuntil nearly one o\\'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose\\nup from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked\\ncupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a\\nrope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing\\nthese articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting\\ndefiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished  light, and went out.\\n  Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to\\nbed, was not long after his father. Under cover of  darkness he\\nfollowed out of  room, followed down  stairs, followed down\\n court, followed out into  streets. He was in no uneasiness\\nconcerning his getting into  house again, for it was full of\\nlodgers, and  door stood ajar all night.\\n  Impelled by a laudable ambition to study  art and mystery of\\nhis father\\'s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house\\nfronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another,\\nheld his honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering\\nNorthward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of\\nIzaak Walton, and  two trudged on together.\\n  Within half an hour from  first starting, they were beyond \\nwinking lamps, and  more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a\\nlonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here- and that so\\nsilently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have\\nsupposed  second follower of  gentle craft to have, all of a\\nsudden, split himself into two.\\n  The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until  three\\nstopped under a bank overhanging  road. Upon  top of  bank\\nwas a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In  shadow\\nof bank and wall  three turned out of  road, and up a blind\\nlane, of which  wall- there, risen to some eight or ten feet\\nhigh- formed one side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up \\nlane,  next object that Young Jerry saw, was  form of his\\nhonoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded\\nmoon, nimbly scaling an iron gate. He was soon over, and then \\nsecond fisherman got over, and then  third. They all dropped softly\\non  ground within  gate, and lay there a little- listening\\nperhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands and knees.\\n  It was now Young Jerry\\'s turn to approach  gate: which he did,\\nholding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and\\nlooking in, he made out  three fishermen creeping through some rank\\ngrass! and all  gravestones in  churchyard- it was a large\\nchurchyard that they were in- looking on like ghosts in white, while\\n church tower itself looked on like  ghost of a monstrous giant.\\nThey did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And\\nthen they began to fish.\\n  They fished with a spade, at first. Presently  honoured parent\\nappeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.\\nWhatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until  awful\\nstriking of  church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made\\noff, with his hair as stiff as his father\\'s.\\n  But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not\\nonly stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They\\nwere still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at  gate for\\n second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was\\na screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures\\nwere strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees  weight broke\\naway  earth upon it, and came to  surface. Young Jerry very well\\nknew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured\\nparent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to \\nsight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a\\nmile or more.\\n  He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than\\nbreath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly\\ndesirable to get to  end of. He had a strong idea that  coffin\\nhe had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on\\nbehind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on  point\\nof overtaking him and hopping on at his side- perhaps taking his\\narm- it was a pursuer to shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous\\nfiend too, for, while it was making  whole night behind him\\ndreadful, he darted out into  roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful\\nof its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy\\'s-Kite\\nwithout tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible\\nshoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it\\nwere laughing. It got into shadows on  road, and lay cunningly on\\nits back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on\\nbehind and gaining on him, so that when  boy got to his own door he\\nhad reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave\\nhim, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled\\ninto bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when\\nhe fell asleep.\\n  From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened\\nafter daybreak and before sunrise, by  presence of his father in\\n family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young\\nJerry inferred, from  circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher\\nby  ears, and knocking  back of her head against \\nhead-board of  bed.\\n  \"I told you I would,\" said Mr. Cruncher, \"and I did.\"\\n  \"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!\" his wife implored.\\n  \"You oppose yourself to  profit of  business,\" said Jerry,\\n\"and me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why \\ndevil don\\'t you?\"\\n  \"I try to be a good wife, Jerry,\"  poor woman protested, with\\ntears.\\n  \"Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband\\'s business? Is it\\nhonouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your\\nhusband to disobey him on  vital subject of his business?\"\\n  \"You hadn\\'t taken to  dreadful business then, Jerry.\"\\n  \"It\\'s enough for you,\" retorted Mr. Cruncher, \"to be  wife of a\\nhonest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations\\nwhen he took to his trade or when he didn\\'t. A honouring and obeying\\nwife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious\\nwoman? If you\\'re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You\\nhave no more nat\\'ral sense of duty than  bed of this here Thames\\nriver has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.\"\\n  The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated\\nin  honest tradesman\\'s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying\\ndown at his length on  floor. After taking a timid peep at him\\nlying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow,\\nhis son lay down too, and fell asleep again.\\n  There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else.\\nMr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron\\npot-lid by him as a projectile for  correction of Mrs. Cruncher. in\\ncase he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was\\nbrushed and washed at  usual hour, and set off with his son to\\npursue his ostensible calling.\\n  Young Jerry, walking with  stool under his arm at his father\\'s\\nside along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different\\nYoung Jerry from him of  previous night, running home through\\ndarkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh\\nwith  day, and his qualms were gone with  night- in which\\nparticulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in\\nFleet-street and  City of London, that fine morning.\\n  \"Father,\" said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to\\nkeep at arm\\'s length and to have  stool well between them:\\n\"what\\'s a Resurrection-Man?\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on  pavement before he answered, \"How\\nshould I know?\"\\n  \"I thought you knowed everything, father,\" said  artless boy.\\n  \"Hem! Well,\" returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting of\\nhis hat to give his spikes free play, \"he\\'s a tradesman.\"\\n  \"What\\'s his goods, father?\" asked  brisk Young Jerry.\\n  \"His goods,\" said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind,\\n\"is a branch of Scientific goods.\"\\n  \"Persons\\' bodies, ain\\'t it, father?\" asked  lively boy.\\n  \"I believe it is something of that sort,\" said Mr. Cruncher.\\n  \"Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I\\'m\\nquite growed up!\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and\\nmoral way. \"It depends upon how you develop your talents. Be careful\\nto develop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to\\nnobody, and there\\'s no telling at  present time what you may not\\ncome to be fit for.\" As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few\\nyards in advance, to plant  stool in  shadow of  Bar, Mr.\\nCruncher added to himself: \"Jerry, you honest tradesman, there\\'s hopes\\nwot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you\\nfor his mother!\"\\n  XV\\n  KNITTING\\n\\n  THERE HAD BEEN earlier drinking than usual in  wine-shop of\\nMonsieur Defarge. As early as six o\\'clock in  morning, sallow faces\\npeeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within,\\nbending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin\\nwine at  best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually\\nthin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a\\nsouring, for its influence on  mood of those who drank it was to\\nmake them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of \\npressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that\\nburnt in  dark, lay hidden in  dregs of it.\\n  This had been  third morning in succession, on which there had\\nbeen early drinking at  wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun\\non Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early\\nbrooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and\\nslunk about there from  time of  opening of  door, who\\ncould not have laid a piece of money on  counter to save their\\nsouls. These were to  full as interested in  place, however,\\nas if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided\\nfrom seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in\\nlieu of drink, with greedy looks.\\n  Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company,  master of \\nwineshop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed\\n threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to\\nsee only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over  distribution\\nof wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much\\ndefaced and beaten out of their original impress as  small\\ncoinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.\\n  A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps\\nobserved by  spies who looked in at  wine-shop, as they looked\\nin at every place, high and low, from  king\\'s palace to \\ncriminal\\'s gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes\\nmusingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on  tables\\nwith spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out \\npattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard\\nsomething inaudible and invisible a long way off.\\n  Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday.\\nIt was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets\\nand under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: \\nother a mender of roads in a blue cap. AH adust and athirst,  two\\nentered  wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in \\nbreast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which\\nstirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows.\\nYet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered\\n wine-shop, though  eyes of every man there were turned upon\\nthem.\\n  \"Good day, gentlemen!\" said Monsieur Defarge.\\n  It may have been a signal for loosening  general tongue. It\\nelicited an answering chorus of \"Good day!\"\\n  \"It is bad weather, gentlemen,\" said Defarge, shaking his head.\\n  Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast\\ndown their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went\\nout.\\n  \"My wife,\" said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: \"I have\\ntravelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called\\nJacques. I met him- by accident- a day and half\\'s journey out of\\nParis. He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques.\\nGive him to drink, my wife!\"\\n  A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before \\nmender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to \\ncompany, and drank. In  breast of his blouse he carried some coarse\\ndark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and\\ndrinking near Madame Defarge\\'s counter. A third man got up and went\\nout.\\n  Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine- but, he took\\nless than was given to  stranger, as being himself a man to whom it\\nwas no rarity- and stood waiting until  countryman had made his\\nbreakfast. He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at\\nhim; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was\\nat work.\\n  \"Have you finished your repast, friend?\" he asked, in due season.\\n  \"Yes, thank you.\"\\n  \"Come, then! You shall see  apartment that I told you you occupy.\\nIt will suit you to a marvel.\"\\n  Out of  wine-shop into  street, out of  street into a\\ncourtyard, out of  courtyard up a steep staircase, out of \\nstaircase into a garret,- formerly  garret where a white-haired man\\nsat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.\\n  No white-haired man was there now; but,  three men were there who\\nhad gone out of  wine-shop singly. And between them and \\nwhite-haired man afar off, was  one small link, that they had\\nonce looked in at him through  chinks in  wall.\\n  Defarge closed  door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:\\n  \"Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is  witness\\nencountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.\\nSpeak, Jacques Five!\"\\n  The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead\\nwith it, and said, \"Where shall I commence, monsieur?\"\\n  \"Commence,\" was Monsieur Defarge\\'s not unreasonable reply, \"at \\ncommencement.\"\\n  \"I saw him then, messieurs,\" began  mender of roads, \"a year\\nago this running summer, underneath  carriage of  Marquis,\\nhanging by  chain. Behold  manner of it. I leaving my work on\\n road,  sun going to bed,  carriage of  Marquis slowly\\nascending  hill, he hanging by  chain-like this.\"\\n  Again  mender of roads went through  whole performance; in\\nwhich he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had\\nbeen  infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his\\nvillage during a whole year.\\n  Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen  man before?\\n  \"Never,\" answered  mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.\\n  Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?\\n  \"By his tall figure,\" said  mender of roads, softly, and with his\\nfinger at his nose. \"When Monsieur  Marquis demands that evening,\\n\\'Say, what is he like?\\' I make response, \\'Tall as a spectre.\\'\"\\n  \"You should have said, short as a dwarf,\" returned Jacques Two.\\n  \"But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither\\ndid he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do\\nnot offer my testimony. Monsieur  Marquis indicates me with his\\nfinger, standing near our little fountain, and says, \\'To me! Bring\\nthat rascal!\\' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\"\\n  \"He is right there, Jacques,\" murmured Defarge, to him who had\\ninterrupted. \"Go on!\"\\n  \"Good!\" said  mender of roads, with an air of mystery. \"The\\ntall man is lost, and he is sought- how many months? Nine, ten,\\neleven?\"\\n  \"No matter,  number,\" said Defarge. \"He is well hidden, but at\\nlast he is unluckily found. Go on!\"\\n  \"I am again at work upon  hill-side, and  sun is again about\\nto go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down\\nin  village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my\\neyes, and see coming over  hill six soldiers. In  midst of\\nthem is a tall man with his arms bound- tied to his sides- like this!\"\\n  With  aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his\\nelbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind\\nhim.\\n  \"I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see  soldiers\\nand their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any\\nspectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I\\nsee no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and\\nthat they are almost black to my sight- except on  side of \\nsun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see\\nthat their long shadows are on  hollow ridge on  opposite side\\nof  road, and are on  hill above it, and are like  shadows of\\ngiants. Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that  dust\\nmoves with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance\\nquite near to me, I recognise  tall man, and he recognises me.\\nAh, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over \\nhill-side once again, as on  evening when he and I first\\nencountered, close to  same spot!\"\\n  He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he\\nsaw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.\\n  \"I do not show  soldiers that I recognise  tall man; he does\\nnot show  soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it,\\nwith our eyes. \\'Come on!\\' says  chief of that company, pointing\\nto  village, \\'bring him fast to his tomb!\\' and they bring him\\nfaster. I follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so\\ntight, his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame.\\nBecause he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him with their\\nguns-like this!\"\\n  He imitated  action of a man\\'s being impelled forward by \\nbutt-ends of muskets.\\n  \"As they descend  hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They\\nlaugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with\\ndust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring\\nhim into  village; all  village runs to look; they take him past\\n mill, and up to  prison; all  village sees  prison gate\\nopen in  darkness of  night, and swallow him- like this!\"\\n  He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding\\nsnap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar  effect by\\nopening it again, Defarge said, \"Go on, Jacques.\"\\n  \"All  village,\" pursued  mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a\\nlow voice, \"withdraws; all  village whispers by  fountain; all\\n village sleeps; all  village dreams of that unhappy one, within\\n locks and bars of  prison on  crag, and never to come out of\\nit, except to perish. In  morning, with my tools upon my\\nshoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by\\n prison, on my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind \\nbars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking\\nthrough. He has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him;\\nhe regards me like a dead man.\"\\n  Defarge and  three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of\\nall of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened\\nto  countryman\\'s story;  manner of all of them, while it was\\nsecret, was authoritative too. They had  air of a rough tribunal;\\nJacques One and Two sitting on  old pallet-bed, each with his\\nchin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on  road-mender;\\nJacques Three, equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his\\nagitated hand always gliding over  network of fine nerves about his\\nmouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and  narrator, whom\\nhe had stationed in  light of  window, by turns looking from him\\nto them, and from them to him.\\n  \"Go on, Jacques,\" said Defarge.\\n  \"He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks\\nat him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a\\ndistance, at  prison on  crag; and in  evening, when  work\\nof  day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at  fountain, all\\nfaces are turned towards  prison. Formerly, they were turned\\ntowards  posting-house; now, they are turned towards  prison.\\nThey whisper at  fountain, that although condemned to death he will\\nnot be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris,\\nshowing that he was enraged and made mad by  death of his child;\\nthey say that a petition has been presented to  King himself.\\nWhat do I know? It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.\"\\n  \"Listen then, Jacques,\" Number One of that name sternly\\ninterposed. \"Know that a petition was presented to  King and Queen.\\nAll here, yourself excepted, saw  King take it, in his carriage\\nin  street, sitting beside  Queen. It is Defarge whom you see\\nhere, who, at  hazard of his life, darted out before  horses,\\nwith  petition in his hand.\"\\n  \"And once again listen, Jacques!\" said  kneeling Number Three:\\nhis fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a\\nstrikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something- that was\\nneither food nor drink; \" guard, horse and foot, surrounded \\npetitioner, and struck him blows. You hear?\"\\n  \"I hear, messieurs.\"\\n  \"Go on then,\" said Defarge.\\n  \"Again; on  other hand, they whisper at  fountain,\" resumed\\n countryman, \"that he is brought down into our country to be\\nexecuted on  spot, and that he will very certainly be executed.\\nThey even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because\\nMonseigneur was  father of his tenants- serfs- what you will- he\\nwill be executed as a parricide. One old man says at  fountain,\\nthat his right hand, armed with  knife, will be burnt off before\\nhis face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his\\nbreast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead,\\nhot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from\\nlimb by four strong horses. That old man says, all this was actually\\ndone to a prisoner who made an attempt on  life of  late King,\\nLouis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies? I am not a scholar.\"\\n  \"Listen once again then, Jacques!\" said  man with  restless\\nhand and  craving air. \"The name of that prisoner was Damiens,\\nand it was all done in open day, in  open streets of this city of\\nParis; and nothing was more noticed in  vast concourse that saw\\nit done, than  crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were fun\\nof eager attention to  last- to  last, Jacques, prolonged\\nuntil nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still\\nbreathed! And it was done why, how old are you?\"\\n  \"Thirty-five,\" said  mender of roads, who looked sixty.\\n  \"It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have\\nseen it.\"\\n  \"Enough!\" said Defarge, with grim impatience. \"Long live \\nDevil! Go on.\"\\n  \"Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing\\nelse; even  fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on\\nSunday night when all  village is asleep, come soldiers, winding\\ndown from  prison, and their guns ring on  stones of \\nlittle street. Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing;\\nin  morning, by  fountain, there is raised a gallows forty\\nfeet high, poisoning  water.\"\\n  The mender of roads looked through rather than at  low ceiling,\\nand pointed as if he saw  gallows somewhere in  sky.\\n  \"All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads  cows out,\\n cows are there with  rest. At midday,  roll of drums.\\nSoldiers have marched into  prison in  night, and he is in \\nmidst of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth\\nthere is a gag-tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as\\nif he laughed.\" He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two\\nthumbs, from  corners of his mouth to his ears. \"On  top of\\n gallows is fixed  knife, blade upwards, with its point in \\nair. He is hanged there forty feet high- and is left hanging,\\npoisoning  water.\"\\n  They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his\\nface, on which  perspiration had started afresh while he recalled\\n spectacle.\\n  \"It is frightful, messieurs. How can  women and  children draw\\nwater! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have\\nI said? When I left  village, Monday evening as  sun was going\\nto bed, and looked back from  hill,  shadow struck across \\nchurch, across  mill, across  prison- seemed to strike across\\n earth, messieurs, to where  sky rests upon it!\"\\n  The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at  other\\nthree, and his finger quivered with  craving that was on him.\\n  \"That\\'s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to\\ndo), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as\\nI was warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding\\nand now walking, through  rest of yesterday and through last night.\\nAnd here you see me!\"\\n  After a gloomy silence,  first Jacques said, \"Good! You have\\nacted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside\\n door?\"\\n  \"Very willingly,\" said  mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to\\n top of  stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.\\n  The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back\\nto  garret.\\n  \"How say you, Jacques?\" demanded Number One. \"To be registered?\"\\n  \"To be registered, as doomed to destruction,\" returned Defarge.\\n  \"Magnificent!\" croaked  man with  craving.\\n  \"The chateau, and all  race?\" inquired  first.\\n  \"The chateau and all  race,\" returned Defarge. \"Extermination.\"\\n  The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, \"Magnificent!\" and\\nbegan gnawing another finger.\\n  \"Are you sure,\" asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, \"that no\\nembarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping  register?\\nWithout doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it;\\nbut shall we always be able to decipher it- or, I ought to say, will\\nshe?\"\\n  \"Jacques,\" returned Defarge, drawing himself up, \"if madame my\\nwife undertook to keep  register in her memory alone, she would not\\nlose a word of it- not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own\\nstitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as \\nsun. Confide in Madame Defarge. It would be easier for  weakest\\npoltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase\\none letter of his name or crimes from  knitted register of Madame\\nDefarge.\"\\n  There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then  man\\nwho hungered, asked: \"Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope\\nso. He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?\"\\n  \"He knows nothing,\" said Defarge; \"at least nothing more than\\nwould easily elevate himself to a gallows of  same height. I charge\\nmyself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him,\\nand set him on his road. He wishes to see  fine world-  King,\\n Queen, and Court; let him see them on Sunday.\"\\n  \"What?\" exclaimed  hungry man, staring. \"Is it a good sign,\\nthat he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?\"\\n  \"Jacques,\" said Defarge; \"judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish\\nher to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if\\nyou wish him to bring it down one day.\"\\n  Nothing more was said, and  mender of roads, being found\\nalready dozing on  topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down\\non  pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was\\nsoon asleep.\\n  Worse quarters than Defarge\\'s wine-shop, could easily have been\\nfound in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a\\nmysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his\\nlife was very new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her\\ncounter, so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly\\ndetermined not to perceive that his being there had any connection\\nwith anything below  surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes\\nwhenever his eye lighted on her. For, he contended with himself that\\nit was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he\\nfelt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented\\nhead to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards\\nflay  victim, she would infallibly go through with it until \\nplay was played out.\\n  Therefore, when Sunday came,  mender of roads was not enchanted\\n(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany\\nmonsieur and himself to Versailles. It was additionally\\ndisconcerting to have madame knitting all  way there, in a public\\nconveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in\\n crowd in  afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as\\n crowd waited to see  carriage of  King and Queen.\\n  \"You work hard, madame,\" said a man near her.\\n  \"Yes,\" answered Madame Defarge; \"I have a good deal to do.\"\\n  \"What do you make, madame?\"\\n  \"Many things.\"\\n  \"For instance-\"\\n  \"For instance,\" returned Madame Defarge, composedly, \"shrouds.\"\\n  The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and \\nmender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it\\nmightily close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to\\nrestore him, he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for,\\nsoon  large-faced King and  fair-faced Queen came in their\\ngolden coach, attended by  shining Bull\\'s Eye of their Court, a\\nglittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in\\njewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning\\nfigures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes,  mender of\\nroads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he\\ncried Long live  King, Long live  Queen, Long live everybody and\\neverything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his\\ntime. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green\\nbanks, more King and Queen, more Bull\\'s Eye, more lords and ladies,\\nmore Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment.\\nDuring  whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he\\nhad plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and\\nthroughout Defarge held him by  collar, as if to restrain him\\nfrom flying at  objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to\\npieces.\\n  \"Bravo!\" said Defarge, clapping him on  back when it was over,\\nlike a patron; \"you are a good boy!\"\\n  The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful\\nof having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.\\n  \"You are  fellow we want,\" said Defarge, in his ear; \"you make\\nthese fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are \\nmore insolent, and it is  nearer ended.\"\\n  \"Hey!\" cried  mender of roads, reflectively; \"that\\'s true.\"\\n  \"These fools know nothing. while they despise your breath, and would\\nstop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than\\nin one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath\\ntells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot\\ndeceive them too much.\"\\n  Madame Defarge looked superciliously at  client, and nodded in\\nconfirmation.\\n  \"As to you,\" said she, \"you would shout and shed tears for anything,\\nif it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?\"\\n  \"Truly, madame, I think so. For  moment.\"\\n  \"If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them\\nto pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you\\nwould pick out  richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?\"\\n  \"Truly yes, madame.\"\\n  \"Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and\\nwere set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own\\nadvantage, you would set upon  birds of  finest feathers;\\nwould you not?\"\\n  \"It is true, madame.\"\\n  \"You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,\" said Madame Defarge,\\nwith a wave of her hand towards  place where they had last been\\napparent; \"now, go home!\"\\n  XVI\\n  STILL KNITTING\\n\\n  MADAME DEFARGE and monsieur her husband returned amicably to \\nbosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through \\ndarkness, and through  dust, and down  weary miles of avenue\\nby  wayside, slowly tending towards that point of  compass where\\n chateau of Monsieur  Marquis, now in his grave, listened to \\nwhispering trees. Such ample leisure had  stone faces, now, for\\nlistening to  trees and to  fountain, that  few village\\nscarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of\\ndead stick to burn, strayed within sight of  great stone\\ncourtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved\\nfancy that  expression of  faces was altered. A rumour just\\nlived in  village- had a faint and bare existence there, as its\\npeople had- that when  knife struck home,  faces changed, from\\nfaces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that\\ndangling figure was hauled up forty feet above  fountain, they\\nchanged again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they\\nwould henceforth bear for ever. In  stone face over  great\\nwindow of  bed-chamber where  murder was done, two fine dints\\nwere pointed out in  sculptured nose, which everybody recognised,\\nand which nobody had seen of old; and on  scarce occasions when two\\nor three ragged peasants emerged from  crowd to take a hurried peep\\nat Monsieur  Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have\\npointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among \\nmoss and leaves, like  more fortunate hares who could find a living\\nthere.\\n  Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure,  red stain on\\n stone floor, and  pure water in  village well- thousands\\nof acres of land- a whole province of France- all France itself- lay\\nunder  night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So\\ndoes a whole world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie\\nin a twinkling star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of\\nlight and analyse  manner of its composition, so, sublimer\\nintelligences may read in  feeble shining of this earth of ours,\\nevery thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible\\ncreature on it.\\n  The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under \\nstarlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto\\ntheir journey naturally tended. There was  usual stoppage at \\nbarrier guardhouse, and  usual lanterns came glancing forth for \\nusual examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing\\none or two of  soldiery there, and one of  police. The latter he\\nwas intimate with, and affectionately embraced.\\n  When Saint Antoine had again enfolded  Defarges in his dusky\\nwings, and they, having finally alighted near  Saint\\'s\\nboundaries, were picking their way on foot through  black mud and\\noffal of his streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:\\n  \"Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of  police tell thee?\"\\n  \"Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy\\ncommissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that\\nhe can say, but he knows of one.\"\\n  \"Eh well!\" said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool\\nbusiness air. \"It is necessary to register him. How do they call\\nthat man?\"\\n  \"He is English.\"\\n  \"So much  better. His name?\"\\n  \"Barsad,\" said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he\\nhad been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with\\nperfect correctness.\\n  \"Barsad,\" repeated madame. \"Good. Christian name?\"\\n  \"John.\"\\n  \"John Barsad,\" repeated madame, after murmuring it once to\\nherself. \"Good. His appearance; is it known?\"\\n  \"Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;\\ncomplexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face\\nthin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a\\npeculiar inclination towards  left cheek; expression, therefore,\\nsinister.\"\\n  \"Eh my faith. It is a portrait!\" said madame, laughing. \"He shall be\\nregistered to-morrow.\"\\n  They turned into  wine-shop, which was closed (for it was\\nmidnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her\\ndesk, counted  small moneys that had been taken during her\\nabsence examined  stock, went through  entries in  book, made\\nother entries of her own, checked  serving man in every possible\\nway, and finally dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out \\ncontents of  bowl of money for  second time, and began\\nknotting them up in her handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots,\\nfor safe keeping through  night. All this while, Defarge, with\\nhis pipe in his mouth, walked up and down, complacently admiring,\\nbut never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to \\nbusiness and his domestic affairs, he walked up and down through life.\\n  The night was hot, and  shop, close shut and surrounded by so\\nfoul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge\\'s olfactory\\nsense was by no means delicate, but  stock of wine smelt much\\nstronger than it ever tasted, and so did  stock of rum and brandy\\nand aniseed. He whiffed  compound of scents away, as he put down\\nhis smoked-out pipe.\\n  \"You are fatigued,\" said madame, raising her glance as she knotted\\n money. \"There are only  usual odours.\"\\n  \"I am a little tired,\" her husband acknowledged.\\n  \"You are a little depressed, too,\" said madame, whose quick eyes had\\nnever been so intent on  accounts, but they had had a ray or two\\nfor him. \"Oh,  men,  men!\"\\n  \"But my dear!\" began Defarge.\\n  \"But my dear!\" repeated madame, nodding firmly; \"but my dear!\\n  You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!\"\\n  \"Well, then,\" said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his\\nbreast, \"it is a long time.\"\\n  \"It is a long time,\" repeated his wife; \"and when is it not a long\\ntime? Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is  rule.\"\\n  \"It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,\"\\nsaid Defarge.\\n  \"How long,\" demanded madame, composedly, \"does it take to make and\\nstore  lightning? Tell me.\"\\n  Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something\\nin that too.\\n  \"It does not take a long time,\" said madame, \"for an earthquake to\\nswallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare \\nearthquake?\"\\n  \"A long time, I suppose,\" said Defarge.\\n  \"But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces\\neverything before it. In  meantime, it is always preparing,\\nthough it is not seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.\"\\n  She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.\\n  \"I tell thee,\" said madame, extending her right hand, for\\nemphasis, \"that although it is a long time on  road, it is on \\nroad and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I\\ntell thee it is always advancing. Look around and consider  lives\\nof all  world that we know, consider  faces of all  world\\nthat we know, consider  rage and discontent to which \\nJacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour.\\nCan such things last? Bah! I mock you.\"\\n  \"My brave wife,\" returned Defarge, standing before her with his head\\na little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and\\nattentive pupil before his catechist, \"I do not question all this. But\\nit has lasted a long time, and it is possible- you know well, my wife,\\nit is possible- that it may not come, during our lives.\"\\n  \"Eh well! How then?\" demanded madame, tying another knot, as if\\nthere were another enemy strangled.\\n  \"Well!\" said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic\\nshrug. \"We shall not see  triumph.\"\\n  \"We shall have helped it,\" returned madame, with her extended hand\\nin strong action. \"Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe,\\nwith all my soul, that we shall see  triumph. But even if not, even\\nif I knew certainly not, show me  neck of an aristocrat and tyrant,\\nand still I would--\"\\n  Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.\\n  \"Hold!\" cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with\\ncowardice; \"I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.\"\\n  \"Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your\\nvictim and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself\\nwithout that. When  time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil;\\nbut wait for  time with  tiger and  devil chained- not shown-\\nyet always ready.\"\\n  Madame enforced  conclusion of this piece of advice by striking\\nher little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its\\nbrains out, and then gathering  heavy handkerchief under her arm in\\na serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.\\n  Next noontide saw  admirable woman in her usual place in \\nwine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if\\nshe now and then glanced at  flower, it was with no infraction of\\nher usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not\\ndrinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,\\nand heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and\\nadventurous perquisitions into all  glutinous little glasses near\\nmadame, fell dead at  bottom. Their decease made no impression on\\n other flies out promenading, who looked at them in  coolest\\nmanner (as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far\\nremoved), until they met  same fate. Curious to consider how\\nheedless flies are!- perhaps they thought as much at Court that\\nsunny summer day.\\n  A figure entering at  door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which\\nshe felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin\\nher rose in her head-dress, before she looked at  figure.\\n  It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up  rose, \\ncustomers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of \\nwineshop.\\n  \"Good day, madame,\" said  new-comer.\\n  \"Good day, monsieur.\"\\n  She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her\\nknitting: \"Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet\\nnine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark,\\neyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight,\\nhaving a peculiar inclination towards  left cheek which imparts a\\nsinister expression! Good day, one and all!\"\\n  \"Have  goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a\\nmouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\"\\n  Madame complied with a polite air.\\n  \"Marvellous cognac this, madame!\"\\n  It was  first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame\\nDefarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,\\nhowever, that  cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting.\\nThe visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took \\nopportunity of observing  place in general.\\n  \"You knit with great skill, madame.\"\\n  \"I am accustomed to it.\"\\n  \"A pretty pattern too!\"\\n  \"You think so?\" said madame, looking at him with a smile.\\n  \"Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?\"\\n  \"Pastime,\" said madame, still looking at him with a smile while\\nher fingers moved nimbly.\\n  \"Not for use?\"\\n  \"That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do-- Well,\"\\nsaid madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind\\nof coquetry, \"I\\'ll use it!\"\\n  It was remarkable; but,  taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be\\ndecidedly opposed to a rose on  head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two\\nmen had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\\ncatching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of\\nlooking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went\\naway. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered,\\nwas there one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his\\neyes open, but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged\\naway in a poverty stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite\\nnatural and unimpeachable.\\n  \"JOHN,\" thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers\\nknitted, and her eyes looked at  stranger. \"Stay long enough, and I\\nshall knit \\'BARSAD\\' before you go.\"\\n  \"You have a husband, madame?\"\\n  \"I have.\"\\n  \"Children?\"\\n  \"No children.\"\\n  \"Business seems bad?\"\\n  \"Business is very bad;  people are so poor.\"\\n  \"Ah,  unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too- as you\\nsay.\"\\n  \"As you say,\" madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting\\nan extra something into his name that boded him no good.\\n  \"Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally\\nthink so. Of course.\"\\n  \"I think?\" returned madame, in a high voice. \"I and my husband\\nhave enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All\\nwe think, here, is how to live. That is  subject we think of, and\\nit gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without\\nembarrassing our heads concerning others. I think for others? No, no.\"\\n   The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make,\\ndid not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister\\nface; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow\\non Madame Defarge\\'s little counter, and occasionally sipping his\\ncognac.\\n  \"A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard\\'s execution. Ah!  poor\\nGaspard!\" With a sigh of great compassion.\\n  \"My faith!\" returned madame, coolly and lightly, \"if people use\\nknives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew\\nbeforehand what  price of his luxury was; he has paid  price.\"\\n  \"I believe,\" said  spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that\\ninvited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary\\nsusceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \"I believe there is\\nmuch compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching  poor\\nfellow? Between ourselves.\"\\n  \"Is there?\" asked madame, vacantly.\\n  \"Is there not?\"\\n  \"-Here is my husband!\" said Madame Defarge.\\n  As  keeper of  wine-shop entered at  door,  spy\\nsaluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile,\\n\"Good day, Jacques!\" Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.\\n  \"Good day, Jacques!\"  spy repeated; with not quite so much\\nconfidence, or quite so easy a smile under  stare.\\n  \"You deceive yourself, monsieur,\" returned  keeper of \\nwineshop. \"You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am\\nErnest Defarge.\"\\n  \"It is all  same,\" said  spy, airily, but discomfited too:\\n\"good day!\\n  \"Good day!\" answered Defarge, drily.\\n  \"I was saying to madame, with whom I had  pleasure of chatting\\nwhen you entered, that they tell me there is- and no wonder!- much\\nsympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching  unhappy fate of poor\\nGaspard.\"\\n  \"No one has told me so,\" said Defarge, shaking his head. \"I know\\nnothing of it.\"\\n  Having said it, he passed behind  little counter, and stood\\nwith his hand on  back of his wife\\'s chair, looking over that\\nbarrier at  person to whom they were both opposed, and whom\\neither of them would have shot with  greatest satisfaction.\\n  The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious\\nattitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of\\nfresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge\\npoured it out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little\\nsong over it.\\n  \"You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I\\ndo?\" observed Defarge.\\n  \"Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly\\ninterested in its miserable inhabitants.\"\\n  \"Hah!\" muttered Defarge.\\n  \"The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to\\nme,\" pursued  spy, \"that I have  honour of cherishing some\\ninteresting associations with your name.\"\\n  \"Indeed!\" said Defarge, with much indifference.\\n  \"Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old\\ndomestic, had  charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you.\\nYou see I am informed of  circumstances?\"\\n  \"Such is  fact, certainly,\" said Defarge. He had had it\\nconveyed to him, in an accidental touch of his wife\\'s elbow as she\\nknitted and warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always\\nwith brevity.\\n  \"It was to you,\" said  spy, \"that his daughter came; and it was\\nfrom your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown\\nmonsieur; how is he called?- in a little wig- Lorry- of  bank of\\nTellson and Company- over to England.\"\\n  \"Such is  fact,\" repeated Defarge.\\n  \"Very interesting remembrances!\" said  spy. \"I have known\\nDoctor Manette and his daughter, in England.\"\\n  \"Yes?\" said Defarge.\\n  \"You don\\'t hear much about them now?\" said  spy.\\n  \"No,\" said Defarge.\\n  \"In effect,\" madame struck in, looking up from her work and her\\nlittle song, \"we never hear about them. We received  news of\\ntheir safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but,\\nsince then, they have gradually taken their road in life- we, ours-\\nand we have held no correspondence.\"\\n  \"Perfectly so, madame,\" replied  spy. \"She is going to be\\nmarried.\"\\n  \"Going?\" echoed madame. \"She was pretty enough to have been\\nmarried long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.\"\\n  \"Oh! You know I am English.\"\\n  \"I perceive your tongue is,\" returned madame; \"and what  tongue\\nis, I suppose  man is.\"\\n  He did not take  identification as a compliment; but he made\\n best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his\\ncognac to  end, he added:\\n  \"Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman;\\nto one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of\\nGaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious\\nthing that she is going to marry  nephew of Monsieur  Marquis,\\nfor whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in\\nother words,  present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England,\\nhe is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. D\\'Aulnais is \\nname of his mother\\'s family.\"\\n  Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but  intelligence had a palpable\\neffect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind  little\\ncounter, as to  striking of a light and  lighting of his pipe,\\nhe was troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would\\nhave been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his\\nmind.\\n  Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be\\nworth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad\\npaid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to\\nsay, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward\\nto  pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For\\nsome minutes after he had emerged into  outer presence of Saint\\nAntoine,  husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them,\\nlest he should come back.\\n  \"Can it be true,\" said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at\\nhis wife as he stood smoking with his hand on  back of her chair:\\n\"what he has said of Ma\\'amselle Manette?\"\\n  \"As he has said it,\" returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little,\\n\"it is probably false. But it may be true.\"\\n  \"If it is-\" Defarge began, and stopped.\\n  \"If it is?\" repeated his wife.\\n  \"-And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph- I hope,\\nfor her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.\"\\n  \"Her husband\\'s destiny,\" said Madame Defarge, with her usual\\ncomposure, \"will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to\\n end that is to end him. That is all I know.\"\\n  \"But it is very strange- now, at least, is it not very strange\"-\\nsaid Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,\\n\"that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself,\\nher husband\\'s name should be proscribed under your hand at this\\nmoment, by  side of that infernal dog\\'s who has just left us?\"\\n  \"Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,\"\\nanswered madame. \"I have them both here, of a certainty; and they\\nare both here for their merits; that is enough.\"\\n  She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and\\npresently took  rose out of  handkerchief that was wound about\\nher head. Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that \\nobjectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on  watch\\nfor its disappearance; howbeit,  Saint took courage to lounge in,\\nvery shortly afterwards, and  wine-shop recovered its habitual\\naspect.\\n  In  evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned\\nhimself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and\\ncame to  corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air,\\nMadame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from\\nplace to place and from group to group: a Missionary- there were\\nmany like her- such as  world will do well never to breed again.\\nAll  women knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, \\nmechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking;\\n hands moved for  jaws and  digestive apparatus: if \\nbony fingers had been still,  stomachs would have been more\\nfamine-pinched.\\n  But, as  fingers went,  eyes went, and  thoughts. And as\\nMadame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker\\nand fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with,\\nand left behind.\\n  Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration.\\n\"A great woman,\" said he, \"a strong woman, a grand woman, a\\nfrightfully grand woman!\"\\n  Darkness closed around, and then came  ringing of church bells\\nand  distant beating of  military drums in  Palace Courtyard,\\nas  women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them.\\nAnother darkness was closing in as surely, when  church bells, then\\nringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be\\nmelted into thundering cannon; when  military drums should be\\nbeating to drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as \\nvoice of Power and Plenty, Freedom and Life. So much was closing in\\nabout  women who sat knitting, knitting, they their very selves\\nwere closing in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit\\nknitting, knitting, dropping heads.\\n  XVII\\n  ONE NIGHT\\n\\n  NEVER DID  sun go down with a brighter glory on  quiet\\ncorner in Soho, than one memorable evening when  Doctor and his\\ndaughter sat under  plane-tree together. Never did  moon rise\\nwith a milder radiance over great London, than on that night when it\\nfound them still seated under  tree, and shone upon their faces\\nthrough its leaves.\\n  Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last\\nevening for her father, and they sat alone under  plane-tree.\\n  \"You are happy, my dear father?\"\\n  \"Quite, my child.\"\\n  They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When\\nit was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged\\nherself in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed\\nherself in both ways, at his side under  tree, many and many a\\ntime; but, this time was not quite like any other, and nothing could\\nmake it so.\\n  \"And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in \\nlove that Heaven has so blessed- my love for Charles, and Charles\\'s\\nlove for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to\\nyou, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even\\nby  length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy\\nand self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--\"\\n  Even as it was, she could not command her voice.\\n  In  sad moonlight, she clasped him by  neck, and laid her face\\nupon his breast. In  moonlight which is always sad, as  light of\\n sun itself is- as  light called human life is- at its coming\\nand its going.\\n  \"Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,\\nquite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will\\never interpose between us? I know it well, but do you know it? In your\\nown heart, do you feel quite certain?\"\\n  Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could\\nscarcely have assumed, \"Quite sure, my darling! More than that,\" he\\nadded, as he tenderly kissed her: \"my future is far brighter, Lucie,\\nseen through your marriage, than it could have been- nay, than it ever\\nwas- without it.\"\\n  \"If I could hope that, my father!--\"\\n  \"Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how\\nplain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young,\\ncannot fully appreciate  anxiety I have felt that your life\\nshould not be wasted--\"\\n  She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and\\nrepeated  word.\\n  \"-wasted, my child- should not be wasted, struck aside from \\nnatural order of things- for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot\\nentirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask\\nyourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was\\nincomplete?\"\\n  \"If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite\\nhappy with you.\"\\n  He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been\\nunhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied:\\n  \"My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been\\nCharles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I\\nshould have been  cause, and then  dark part of my life would\\nhave cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\"\\n  It was  first time, except at  trial, of her ever hearing\\nhim refer to  period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and\\nnew sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered\\nit long afterwards.\\n  \"See!\" said  Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards \\nmoon. \"I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not\\nbear her fight. I have looked at her when it has been such torture\\nto me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten\\nmy head against my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so\\ndull and lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but  number of\\nhorizontal lines I could draw across her at  full, and  number\\nof perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them.\" He added in\\nhis inward and pondering manner, as he looked at  moon, \"It was\\ntwenty either way, I remember, and  twentieth was difficult to\\nsqueeze in.\"\\n  The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,\\ndeepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in\\n manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present\\ncheerfulness and felicity with  dire endurance that was over.\\n  \"I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon \\nunborn child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive.\\nWhether it had been born alive, or  poor mother\\'s shock had\\nkilled it. Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his\\nfather. (There was a time in my imprisonment, when my desire for\\nvengeance was unbearable.) Whether it was a son who would never know\\nhis father\\'s story; who might even live to weigh  possibility of\\nhis father\\'s having disappeared of his own will and act. Whether it\\nwas a daughter who would grow to be a woman.\"\\n  She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.\\n  \"I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of\\nme- rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\\ncast up  years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married\\nto a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished\\nfrom  remembrance of  living, and in  next generation my\\nplace was a blank.\"\\n  \"My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter\\nwho never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.\"\\n  \"You, Lucie? It is out of  consolation and restoration you have\\nbrought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us\\nand  moon on this last night.- What did I say just now?\"\\n  \"She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.\"\\n  \"So! But on other moonlight nights, when  sadness and  silence\\nhave touched me in a different way- have affected me with something as\\nlike a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for\\nits foundations could- I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell,\\nand leading me out into  freedom beyond  fortress. I have seen\\nher image in  moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I\\nnever held her in my arms; it stood between  little grated window\\nand  door. But, you understand that that not  child I am\\nspeaking of?\"\\n  \"The figure was not; - - image;  fancy?\"\\n  \"No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of\\nsight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was\\nanother and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no\\nmore than that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness\\ntoo- as you have- but was not  same. Can you follow me, Lucie?\\nHardly, I think? I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to\\nunderstand these perplexed distinctions.\"\\n  His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from\\nrunning cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.\\n  \"In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in  moonlight,\\ncoming to me and taking me out to show me that  home of her married\\nlife was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\\nwas in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\\ncheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.\"\\n  \"I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love\\nthat was I.\"\\n  \"And she showed me her children,\" said  Doctor of Beauvais,\\n\"and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they\\npassed a prison of  State, they kept far from its frowning walls,\\nand looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never\\ndeliver me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing\\nme such things. But then, blessed with  relief of tears, I fell\\nupon my knees, and blessed her.\"\\n  \"I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you\\nbless me as fervently to-morrow?\"\\n  \"Lucie, I recall these old troubles in  reason that I have\\nto-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God\\nfor my great happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never\\nrose near  happiness that I have known with you, and that we have\\nbefore us.\"\\n  He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly\\nthanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went\\ninto  house.\\n  There was no one bidden to  marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was\\neven to be no bridesmaid but  gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to\\nmake no change in their place of residence; they had been able to\\nextend it, by taking to themselves  upper rooms formerly\\nbelonging to  apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing\\nmore.\\n  Doctor Manette was very cheerful at  little supper. They were\\nonly three at table, and Miss Pross made  third. He regretted\\nthat Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to\\n loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him\\naffectionately.\\n  So,  time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they\\nseparated. But, in  stillness of  third hour of  morning,\\nLucie came downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from\\nunshaped fears, beforehand.\\n  All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay\\nasleep, his white hair picturesque on  untroubled pillow, and his\\nhands lying quiet on  coverlet. She put her needless candle in\\n shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to\\nhis; then, leaned over him, and looked at him.\\n  Into his handsome face,  bitter waters of captivity had worn;\\nbut, he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that\\nhe held  mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable\\nface in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen\\nassailant, was not to be beheld in all  wide dominions of sleep,\\nthat night.\\n  She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer\\nthat she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and\\nas his sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his\\nlips once more, and went away. So,  sunrise came, and  shadows\\nof  leaves of  plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as\\nher lips had moved in praying for him.\\n  XVIII\\n  NINE DAYS\\n\\n  THE MARRIAGE-DAY was shining brightly, and they were ready outside\\n closed door of  Doctor\\'s room, where he was speaking with\\nCharles Darnay. They were ready to go to church;  beautiful\\nbride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross- to whom  event, through a gradual\\nprocess of reconcilement to  inevitable, would have been one of\\nabsolute bliss, but for  yet lingering consideration that her\\nbrother Solomon should have been  bridegroom.\\n  \"And so,\" said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire \\nbride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her\\nquiet, pretty dress; \"and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I\\nbrought you across  Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little\\nI thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued  obligation I\\nwas conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!\"\\n  \"You didn\\'t mean it,\" remarked  matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \"and\\ntherefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\"\\n  \"Really? Well; but don\\'t cry,\" said  gentle Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"I am not crying,\" said Miss Pross; \"you are.\"\\n  \"I, my Pross?\" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with\\nher, on occasion.)\\n  \"You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don\\'t wonder at it. Such\\na present of plate as you have made \\'em, is enough to bring tears into\\nanybody\\'s eyes. There\\'s not a fork or a spoon in  collection,\" said\\nMiss Pross, \"that I didn\\'t cry over, last night after  box came,\\ntill I couldn\\'t see it.\"\\n  \"I am highly gratified,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"though, upon my honour,\\nI had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance\\ninvisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man\\nspeculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there\\nmight have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\"\\n  \"Not at all!\" From Miss Pross.\\n  \"You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\" asked \\ngentleman of that name.\\n  \"Pooh!\" rejoined Miss Pross; \"you were a bachelor in your cradle.\"\\n  \"Well!\" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig,\\n\"that seems probable, too.\"\\n  \"And you were cut out for a bachelor,\" pursued Miss Pross, \"before\\nyou were put in your cradle.\"\\n  \"Then, I think,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was very unhandsomely dealt\\nwith, and that I ought to have had a voice in  selection of my\\npattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,\" drawing his arm soothingly round\\nher waist, \"I hear them moving in  next room, and Miss Pross and I,\\nas two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose  final\\nopportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You\\nleave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving\\nas your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during \\nnext fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even\\nTellson\\'s shall go to  wall (comparatively speaking) before him.\\nAnd when, at  fortnight\\'s end, he comes to join you and your\\nbeloved husband, on your other fortnight\\'s trip in Wales, you shall\\nsay that we have sent him to you in  best health and in \\nhappiest frame. Now, I hear Somebody\\'s step coming to  door. Let me\\nkiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before\\nSomebody comes to claim his own.\"\\n  For a moment, he held  fair face from him to look at \\nwell-remembered expression on  forehead, and then laid  bright\\ngolden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness\\nand delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as\\nAdam.\\n  The door of  Doctor\\'s room opened, and he came out with Charles\\nDarnay. He was so deadly pale- which had not been  case when they\\nwent in together- that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his\\nface. But, in  composure of his manner he was unaltered, except\\nthat to  shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy\\nindication that  old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed\\nover him, like a cold wind.\\n  He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to \\nchariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of  day. The rest\\nfollowed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church,\\nwhere no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were\\nhappily married.\\n  Besides  glancing tears that shone among  smiles of  little\\ngroup when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,\\nglanced on  bride\\'s hand, which were newly released from  dark\\nobscurity of one of Mr. Lorry\\'s pockets. They returned home to\\nbreakfast, and all went well, and in due course  golden hair that\\nhad mingled with  poor shoemaker\\'s white locks in  Paris garret,\\nwere mingled with them again in  morning sunlight, on  threshold\\nof  door at parting.\\n  It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father\\ncheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her\\nenfolding arms, \"Take her, Charles! She is yours!\"\\n  And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she\\nwas gone.\\n  The corner being out of  way of  idle and curious, and \\npreparations having been very simple and few,  Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\\nand Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\\n welcome shade of  cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a\\ngreat change to have come over  Doctor; as if  golden arm\\nuplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.\\n  He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have\\nbeen expected in him when  occasion for repression was gone. But,\\nit was  old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through\\nhis absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away\\ninto his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of\\nDefarge  wine-shop keeper, and  starlight ride.\\n  \"I think,\" he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious\\nconsideration, \"I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at\\nall disturb him. I must look in at Tellson\\'s; so I will go there at\\nonce and come back presently. Then, we will take him a ride into \\ncountry, and dine there, and all will be well.\"\\n  It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson\\'s, than to look\\nout of Tellson\\'s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he\\nascended  old staircase alone, having asked no question of \\nservant; going thus into  Doctor\\'s rooms, he was stopped by a low\\nsound of knocking.\\n  \"Good God!\" he said, with a start. \"What\\'s that?\"\\n  Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. \"O me, O me!\\nAll is lost!\" cried she, wringing her hands. \"What is to be told to\\nLadybird? He doesn\\'t know me, and is making shoes!\"\\n  Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into\\n Doctor\\'s room. The bench was turned towards  light, as it had\\nbeen when he had seen  shoemaker at his work before, and his head\\nwas bent down, and he was very busy.\\n  \"Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\"\\n  The Doctor looked at him for a moment- half inquiringly, half as\\nif he were angry at being spoken to- and bent over his work again.\\n  He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at\\n throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even  old\\nhaggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard-\\nimpatiently- as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\\n  Mr. Lorry glanced at  work in his hand, and observed that it\\nwas a shoe of  old size and shape. He took up another that was\\nlying by him, and asked what it was.\\n  \"A young lady\\'s walking shoe,\" he muttered, without looking up.\\n\"It ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\"\\n  \"But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\"\\n  He obeyed, in  old mechanically submissive manner, without\\npausing in his work.\\n  \"You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper\\noccupation. Think, dear friend!\"\\n  Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant\\nat a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would\\nextract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in\\nsilence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an\\necholess wall, or on  air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry\\ncould discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without\\nbeing asked. In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity\\nor perplexity- as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in\\nhis mind.\\n  Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important\\nabove all others;  first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;\\n second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In\\nconjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards \\nlatter precaution, by giving out that  Doctor was not well, and\\nrequired a few days of complete rest. In aid of  kind deception\\nto be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing\\nhis having been called away professionally, and referring to an\\nimaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand,\\nrepresented to have been addressed to her by  same post.\\n  These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\\n hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\\nanother course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that\\nhe thought  best, on  Doctor\\'s case.\\n  In  hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course\\nbeing thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him\\nattentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He\\ntherefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson\\'s for \\nfirst time in his life, and took his post by  window in  same\\nroom.\\n  He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to\\nspeak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned\\nthat attempt on  first day, and resolved merely to keep himself\\nalways before him, as a silent protest against  delusion into which\\nhe had fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat\\nnear  window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many\\npleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free\\nplace.\\n  Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and\\nworked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see- worked on,\\nhalf an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to\\nread or write. When he put his tools aside as useless, until\\nmorning, Mr. Lorry rose and said to him:\\n  \"Will you go out?\"\\n  He looked down at  floor on either side of him in  old manner,\\nlooked up in  old manner, and repeated in  old low voice:\\n  \"Out?\"\\n  \"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\\n  He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.\\nLorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in  dusk,\\nwith his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in\\nsome misty way asking himself, \"Why not?\" The sagacity of  man of\\nbusiness perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\\n  Miss Pross and he divided  night into two watches, and observed\\nhim at intervals from  adjoining room. He paced up and down for a\\nlong time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself\\ndown, he fell asleep. In  morning, he was up betimes, and went\\nstraight to his bench and to work.\\n  On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\\nand spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them.\\nHe returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was\\nsaid, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. This\\nencouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several\\ntimes during  day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and\\nof her father then present, precisely in  usual manner, and as if\\nthere were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative\\naccompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and\\nit lightened Mr. Lorry\\'s friendly heart to believe that he looked up\\noftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of\\ninconsistencies surrounding him.\\n  When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\\n  \"Dear Doctor, will you go out?\"\\n  As before, he repeated, \"Out?\"\\n  \"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\\n  This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no\\nanswer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In\\n meanwhile,  Doctor had removed to  seat in  window, and\\nhad sat there looking down at  plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry\\'s\\nreturn, he slipped away to his bench.\\n  The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry\\'s hope darkened, and his\\nheart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every\\nday. The third day came and went,  fourth,  fifth. Five days,\\nsix days, seven days, eight days, nine days.\\n  With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing\\nheavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The\\nsecret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he\\ncould not fail to observe that  shoemaker, whose hand had been a\\nlittle out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had\\nnever been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so\\nnimble and expert, as in  dusk of  ninth evening.\\n  XIX\\n  AN OPINION\\n\\n  WORN OUT by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post.\\nOn  tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by  shining\\nof  sun into  room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him\\nwhen it was dark night.\\n  He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\\ndone so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to  door of\\n Doctor\\'s room and looking in, he perceived that  shoemaker\\'s\\nbench and tools were put aside again, and that  Doctor himself\\nsat reading at  window. He was in his usual morning dress, and\\nhis face (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very\\npale, was calmly studious and attentive.\\n  Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\\ngiddily uncertain for some few moments whether  late shoemaking\\nmight not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes\\nshow him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and\\naspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their\\nrange, that  change of which he had so strong an impression had\\nactually happened?\\n  It was but  inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment,\\n answer being obvious. If  impression were not produced by a\\nreal corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry,\\nthere? How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on \\nsofa in Doctor Manette\\'s consulting-room, and to be debating these\\npoints outside  Doctor\\'s bedroom door in  early morning?\\n  Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\\nhad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\\nresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He\\nadvised that they should let  time go by until  regular\\nbreakfast-hour, and should then meet  Doctor as if nothing\\nunusual had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of\\nmind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and\\nguidance from  opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to\\nobtain.\\n  Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment,  scheme was\\nworked out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual\\nmethodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at  breakfast-hour\\nin his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor\\nwas summoned in  usual way, and came to breakfast.\\n  So far as it was possible to comprehend him without over stepping\\nthose delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be \\nonly safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter\\'s marriage\\nhad taken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown\\nout, to  day of  week, and  day of  month, set him\\nthinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other\\nrespects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry\\ndetermined to have  aid he sought. And that aid was his own.\\n  Therefore, when  breakfast was done and cleared away, and he\\nand  Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\\n  \"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in\\nconfidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested;\\nthat is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better\\ninformation it may be less so.\"\\n  Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work,\\n Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already\\nglanced at his hands more than once.\\n  \"Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on \\narm, \" case is  case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\\ngive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake- and above\\nall, for his daughter\\'s- his daughter\\'s, my dear Manette.\"\\n  \"If I understand,\" said  Doctor, in a subdued tone, \"some\\nmental shock--?\"\\n  \"Yes!\"\\n  \"Be explicit,\" said  Doctor. \"Spare no detail.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\\n  \"My dear Manette, it is  case of an old and a prolonged shock, of\\ngreat acuteness and severity to  affections,  feelings, -\\n- as you express it-  mind. The mind. It is  case of a\\nshock under which  sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for\\nhow long, because I believe he cannot calculate  time himself,\\nand there are no other means of getting at it. It is  case of a\\nshock from which  sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot\\ntrace himself- as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking\\nmanner. It is  case of a shock from which he has recovered, so\\ncompletely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close\\napplication of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly\\nmaking fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already\\nvery large. But, unfortunately, there has been,\" he paused and took\\na deep breath- \"a slight relapse.\"\\n  The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \"Of how long duration?\"\\n  \"Nine days and nights.\"\\n  \"How did it show itself? I infer,\" glancing at his hands again,\\n\"in  resumption of some old pursuit connected with  shock?\"\\n  \"That is  fact.\"\\n  \"Now, did you ever see him,\" asked  Doctor, distinctly and\\ncollectedly, though in  same low voice, \"engaged in that pursuit\\noriginally?\"\\n  \"Once.\"\\n  \"And when  relapse fell on him, was he in most respects -or in\\nall respects- as he was then?\"\\n  \"I think in all respects.\"\\n  \"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of  relapse?\"\\n  \"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept\\nfrom her. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be\\ntrusted.\"\\n  The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \"That was very kind. That\\nwas very thoughtful!\" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and\\nneither of  two spoke for a little while.\\n  \"Now, my dear Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\\nconsiderate and most affectionate way, \"I am a mere man of business,\\nand unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do\\nnot possess  kind of information necessary; I do not possess \\nkind of intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on\\nwhom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how\\ndoes this relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a\\nrepetition of it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be\\ntreated? How does it come about at all? What can I do for my friend?\\nNo man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a\\nfriend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how. But I don\\'t know how\\nto originate, in such a case. If your sagacity, knowledge, and\\nexperience, could put me on  right track, I might be able to do\\nso much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little. Pray\\ndiscuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\\nand teach me how to be a little more useful.\"\\n  Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken,\\nand Mr. Lorry did not press him.\\n  \"I think it probable,\" said  Doctor, breaking silence with an\\neffort, \"that  relapse you have described, my dear friend, was\\nnot quite unforeseen by its subject.\"\\n  \"Was it dreaded by him?\" Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\\n  \"Very much.\" He said it with an involuntary shudder.\\n  \"You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on \\nsufferer\\'s mind, and how difficult- how almost impossible- it is,\\nfor him to force himself to utter a word upon  topic that oppresses\\nhim.\"\\n  \"Would he,\" asked Mr. Lorry, \"be sensibly relieved if he could\\nprevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when\\nit is on him?\"\\n  \"I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I\\neven believe it- in some cases- to be quite impossible.\"\\n  \"Now,\" said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on  Doctor\\'s arm\\nagain, after a short silence on both sides, \"to what would you refer\\nthis attack?\"\\n  \"I believe,\" returned Doctor Manette, \"that there had been a\\nstrong and extraordinary revival of  train of thought and\\nremembrance that was  first cause of  malady. Some intense\\nassociations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I\\nthink. It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in\\nhis mind, that those associations would be recalled- say, under\\ncertain circumstances- say, on a particular occasion. He tried to\\nprepare himself in vain; perhaps  effort to prepare himself made\\nhim less able to bear it.\"\\n  \"Would he remember what took place in  relapse?\" asked Mr. Lorry,\\nwith natural hesitation.\\n  The Doctor looked desolately round  room, shook his head, and\\nanswered, in a low voice, \"Not at all.\"\\n  \"Now, as to  future,\" hinted Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"As to  future,\" said  Doctor, recovering firmness, \"I\\nshould have great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore\\nhim so soon, I should have great hope. He, yielding under  pressure\\nof a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and\\ncontended against, and recovering after  cloud had burst and\\npassed, I should hope that  worst was over.\"\\n  \"Well, well! That\\'s good comfort. I am thankful!\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"I am thankful!\" repeated  Doctor, bending his head with\\nreverence.\\n  \"There are two other points,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"on which I am anxious\\nto be instructed. I may go on?\"\\n  \"You cannot do your friend a better service.\" The Doctor gave him\\nhis hand.\\n  \"To  first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually\\nenergetic; he applies himself with great ardour to  acquisition\\nof professional knowledge, to  conducting of experiments, to many\\nthings. Now, does he do too much?\"\\n  \"I think not. It may be  character of his mind, to be always in\\nsingular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in\\npart,  result of affliction. The less it was occupied with\\nhealthy things,  more it would be in danger of turning in \\nunhealthy direction. He may have observed himself, and made \\ndiscovery.\"\\n  \"You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\"\\n  \"I think I am quite sure of it.\"\\n  \"My dear Manette, if he were overworked now-\"\\n  \"My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a\\nviolent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\"\\n  \"Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a\\nmoment, that he was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal\\nof this disorder?\"\\n  \"I do not think so. I do not think,\" said Doctor Manette with \\nfirmness of self-conviction, \"that anything but  one train of\\nassociation would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some\\nextraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has\\nhappened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any\\nsuch violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost\\nbelieve, that  circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.\"\\n  He spoke with  diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing\\nwould overset  delicate organisation of  mind, and yet with\\n confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of\\npersonal endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate\\nthat confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged\\nthan he really was, and approached his second and last point. He\\nfelt it to be  most difficult of all; but, remembering his old\\nSunday morning conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he\\nhad seen in  last nine days, he knew that he must face it.\\n  \"The occupation resumed under  influence of this passing\\naffection so happily recovered from,\" said Mr. Lorry, clearing his\\nthroat, \"we will call- Blacksmith\\'s work, Blacksmith\\'s work. We will\\nsay, to put a case and for  sake of illustration, that he had\\nbeen used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge. We will say\\nthat he was unexpectedly found at his forge again. Is it not a pity\\nthat he should keep it by him?\"\\n  The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot\\nnervously on  ground.\\n  \"He has always kept it by him,\" said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look\\nat his friend. \"Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?\"\\n  Still,  Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously\\non  ground.\\n  \"You do not find it easy to advise me?\" said Mr. Lorry. \"I quite\\nunderstand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--\" And there he\\nshook his head, and stopped.\\n  \"You see,\" said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy\\npause, \"it is very hard to explain, consistently,  innermost\\nworkings of this poor man\\'s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for\\nthat occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it\\nrelieved his pain so much, by substituting  perplexity of \\nfingers for  perplexity of  brain, and by substituting, as he\\nbecame more practised,  ingenuity of  hands, for  ingenuity\\nof  mental torture; that he has never been able to bear  thought\\nof putting it quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is\\nmore hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of\\nhimself with a kind of confidence,  idea that he might need that\\nold employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror,\\nlike that which one may fancy strikes to  heart of a lost child.\"\\n  He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr.\\nLorry\\'s face.\\n  \"But may not- mind! I ask for information, a plodding man of\\nbusiness who only deals with such material objects guineas, shillings,\\nand bank-notes- may not  retention of  thing involve \\nretention of  idea? If  thing were gone, my dear Manette,\\nmight not  fear go with it? In short, is it not a concession to \\nmisgiving, to keep  forge?\"\\n  There was another silence.\\n  \"You see, too,\" said  Doctor, tremulously, \"it is such an old\\ncompanion.\"\\n  \"I would not keep it,\" said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he\\ngained in firmness as he saw  Doctor disquieted. \"I would recommend\\nhim to sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does\\nno good. Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his\\ndaughter\\'s sake, my dear Manette!\"\\n  Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!\\n  \"In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would\\nnot take it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is\\nnot there; let him miss his old companion after an absence.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and  conference was ended.\\nThey passed  day in  country, and  Doctor was quite restored.\\nOn  three following days he remained perfectly well, and on \\nfourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The\\nprecaution that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry\\nhad previously explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in\\naccordance with it, and she had no suspicions.\\n  On  night of  day on which he left  house, Mr. Lorry went\\ninto his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by\\nMiss Pross carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a\\nmysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked  shoemaker\\'s bench\\nto pieces, while Miss Pross held  candle as if she were assisting\\nat a murder for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no\\nunsuitable figure. The burning of  body (previously reduced to\\npieces convenient for  purpose) was commenced without delay in\\n kitchen fire; and  tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in\\n garden. So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest\\nminds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while engaged in \\ncommission of their deed and in  removal of its traces, almost\\nfelt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible crime.\\n  XX\\n  A PLEA\\n\\n  WHEN  newly-married pair came home,  first person who\\nappeared, to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had\\nnot been at home many hours, when he presented himself. He was not\\nimproved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain\\nrugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to  observation\\nof Charles Darnay.\\n  He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and\\nof speaking to him when no one overheard.\\n  \"Mr. Darnay,\" said Carton, \"I wish we might be friends.\"\\n  \"We are already friends, I hope.\"\\n  \"You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don\\'t\\nmean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be\\nfriends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.\"\\n  Charles Darnay- as was natural- asked him, in all good-humour and\\ngood-fellowship, what he did mean?\\n  \"Upon my life,\" said Carton, smiling, \"I find that easier to\\ncomprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me\\ntry. You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk\\nthan- than usual?\"\\n  \"I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to\\nconfess that you had been drinking.\"\\n  \"I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me,\\nfor I always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one\\nday, when all days are at an end for me! Don\\'t be alarmed; I am not\\ngoing to preach.\"\\n  \"I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but\\nalarming to me.\"\\n  \"Ah!\" said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he\\nwaved that away. \"On  drunken occasion in question (one of a\\nlarge number, as you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and\\nnot liking you. I wish you would forget it.\"\\n  \"I forgot it long ago.\"\\n  \"Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy\\nto me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means\\nforgotten it, and a light answer does not help me to forget it.\"\\n  \"If it was a light answer,\" returned Darnay, \"I beg your forgiveness\\nfor it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to\\nmy surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you,\\non  faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my\\nmind. Good Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing\\nmore important to remember, in  great service you rendered me\\nthat day?\"\\n  \"As to  great service,\" said Carton, \"I am bound to avow to\\nyou, when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional\\nclaptrap, I don\\'t know that I cared what became of you, when I\\nrendered it. Mind! I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of \\npast.\"\\n  \"You make light of  obligation,\" returned Darnay, \"but I will not\\nquarrel with your light answer.\"\\n  \"Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my\\npurpose; I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you\\nknow I am incapable of all  higher and better flights of men. If\\nyou doubt it, ask Stryver, and he\\'ll tell you so.\"\\n  \"I prefer to form my own opinion, without  aid of his.\"\\n  \"Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never\\ndone any good, and never will.\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know that you \\'never will.\\'\"\\n  \"But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could\\nendure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such\\nindifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask\\nthat I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person\\nhere; that I might be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it\\nwere not for  resemblance I detected between you and me, an\\nunornamental) piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service, and\\ntaken no notice of. I doubt if I should abuse  permission. It is\\na hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a\\nyear. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it.\"\\n  \"Will you try?\"\\n  \"That is another way of saying that I am placed on  footing I\\nhave indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with\\nyour name?\"\\n  \"I think so, Carton, by this time.\"\\n  They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute\\nafterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as\\never.\\n  When he was gone, and in  course of an evening passed with Miss\\nPross,  Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention\\nof this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a\\nproblem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short,\\nnot bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might\\nwho saw him as he showed himself.\\n  He had no idea that this could dwell in  thoughts of his fair\\nyoung wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms,\\nhe found her waiting for him with  old pretty lifting of \\nforehead strongly marked.\\n  \"We are thoughtful to-night!\" said Darnay, drawing his arm about\\nher.\\n  \"Yes, dearest Charles,\" with her hands on his breast, and \\ninquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; \"we are rather\\nthoughtful tonight, for we have something on our mind to-night.\"\\n  \"What is it, my Lucie?\"\\n  \"Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you\\nnot to ask it?\"\\n  \"Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?\"\\n  What, indeed, with his hand putting aside  golden hair from \\ncheek, and his other hand against  heart that beat for him!\\n  \"I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and\\nrespect than you expressed for him to-night.\"\\n  \"Indeed, my own? Why so?\"\\n  \"That is what you are not to ask me. But I think- I know- he does.\"\\n  \"If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?\"\\n  \"I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always,\\nand very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to\\nbelieve that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that\\nthere are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.\"\\n  \"It is a painful reflection to me,\" said Charles Darnay, quite\\nastounded, \"that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought\\nthis of him.\"\\n  \"My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is\\nscarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is\\nreparable now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things,\\ngentle things, even magnanimous things.\"\\n  She looked so beautiful in  purity of her faith in this lost man,\\nthat her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.\\n  \"And, O my dearest Love!\" she urged, clinging nearer to him,\\nlaying her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his,\\n\"remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in\\nhis misery!\"\\n  The supplication touched him home. \"I will always remember it,\\ndear Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.\"\\n  He bent over  golden head, and put  rosy lips to his, and\\nfolded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing  dark\\nstreets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen\\n drops of pity kissed away by her husband from  soft blue eyes\\nso loving of that husband, he might have cried to  night- and \\nwords would not have parted from his lips for  first time-\\n  \"God bless her for her sweet compassion!\"\\n  XXI\\n  ECHOING FOOTSTEPS\\n\\n  A WONDERFUL CORNER for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner\\nwhere  Doctor lived. Ever busily winding  golden thread which\\nbound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress\\nand companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in  still\\nhouse in  tranquilly resounding corner, listening to  echoing\\nfootsteps of years.\\n  At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young\\nwife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes\\nwould be dimmed. For, there was something coming in  echoes,\\nsomething light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred\\nher heart too much. Fluttering hopes and doubts- hopes, of a love as\\nyet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that\\nnew delight-divided her breast. Among  echoes then, there would\\narise  sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of\\n husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her\\nso much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.\\n  That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among\\n advancing echoes, there was  tread of her tiny feet and \\nsound of her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they\\nwould,  young mother at  cradle side could always hear those\\ncoming. They came, and  shady house was sunny with a child\\'s laugh,\\nand  Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had\\nconfided hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took \\nchild of old, and made it a sacred joy to her.\\n  Ever busily winding  golden thread that bound them all\\ntogether, weaving  service of her happy influence through \\ntissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie\\nheard in  echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds.\\nHer husband\\'s step was strong and prosperous among them; her\\nfather\\'s firm and equal. Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string,\\nawakening  echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting\\nand pawing  earth under  plane-tree in  garden!\\n  Even when there were sounds of sorrow among  rest, they were\\nnot harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a\\nhalo on a pillow round  worn face of a little boy, and he said,\\nwith a radiant smile, \"Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave\\nyou both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must\\ngo!\" those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young\\nmother\\'s cheek, as  spirit departed from her embrace that had\\nbeen entrusted to it. Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my\\nFather\\'s face. O Father, blessed words!\\n  Thus,  rustling of an Angel\\'s wings got blended with  other\\nechoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath\\nof Heaven. Sighs of  winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were\\nmingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed\\nmurmur-like  breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore-\\nas  little Lucie, comically studious at  task of  morning, or\\ndressing a doll at her mother\\'s footstool, chattered in  tongues of\\n Two Cities that were blended in her life.\\n  The Echoes rarely answered to  actual tread of Sydney Carton.\\nSome half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of\\ncoming in uninvited, and would sit among them through  evening,\\nas he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And\\none other thing regarding him was whispered in  echoes, which has\\nbeen whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.\\n  No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a\\nblameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a\\nmother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him- an\\ninstinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities\\nare touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was\\nso here. Carton was  first stranger to whom little Lucie held out\\nher chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew. The\\nlittle boy had spoken of him, almost at  last. \"Poor Carton! Kiss\\nhim for me!\"\\n  Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through  law, like some great\\nengine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful\\nfriend in his wake, like a boat towed astern. As  boat so\\nfavoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so,\\nSydney had a swamped life of it. But, easy and strong custom,\\nunhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating\\nsense of desert or disgrace, made it  life he was to lead; and he\\nno more thought of emerging from his state of lion\\'s jackal, than\\nany real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion.\\nStryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three\\nboys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but  straight\\nhair of their dumpling heads.\\n  These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of \\nmost offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like\\nthree sheep to  quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils\\nto Lucie\\'s husband: delicately saying \"Halloa! here are three lumps of\\nbread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!\" The\\npolite rejection of  three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite\\nbloated Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to\\naccount in  training of  young gentlemen, by directing them to\\nbeware of  pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in\\n habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on\\n arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to \"catch\" him, and on\\n diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him\\n\"not to be caught.\" Some of his King\\'s Bench familiars, who were\\noccasionally parties to  full-bodied wine and  lie, excused\\nhim for  latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he\\nbelieved it himself- which is surely such an incorrigible\\naggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such\\noffender\\'s being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and\\nthere hanged out of  way.\\n  These were among  echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive,\\nsometimes amused and laughing, listened in  echoing corner, until\\nher little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart \\nechoes of her child\\'s tread came, and those of her own dear\\nfather\\'s, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear\\nhusband\\'s, need not be told. Nor, how  lightest echo of their\\nunited home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift\\nthat it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her. Nor, how\\nthere were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of  many\\ntimes her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him\\nmarried (if that could be) than single, and of  many times her\\nhusband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide\\nher love for him or her help to him, and asked her \"What is \\nmagic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if\\nthere were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have\\ntoo much to do?\"\\n  But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled\\nmenacingly in  corner all through this space of time. And it was\\nnow, about little Lucie\\'s sixth birthday, that they began to have an\\nawful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.\\n  On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and\\neighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson\\'s, and sat himself\\ndown by Lucie and her husband in  dark window. It was a hot, wild\\nnight, and they were all three reminded of  old Sunday night when\\nthey had looked at  lightning from  same place.\\n  \"I began to think,\" said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back,\\n\"that I should have to pass  night at Tellson\\'s. We have been so\\nfun of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or\\nwhich way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we\\nhave actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there,\\nseem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There\\nis positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.\"\\n  \"That has a bad look,\" said Darnay.\\n  \"A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don\\'t know what\\nreason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at\\nTellson\\'s are getting old, and we really can\\'t be troubled out of\\n ordinary course without due occasion.\"\\n  \"Stiff,\" said Darnay, \"you know how gloomy and threatening  sky\\nis.\"\\n  \"I know that, to be sure,\" assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade\\nhimself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, \"but I\\nam determined to be peevish after my long day\\'s botheration. Where\\nis Manette?\"\\n  \"Here he is,\" said  Doctor, entering  dark room at  moment.\\n  \"I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and\\nforebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me\\nnervous without reason. You are not going out, I hope?\"\\n  \"No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,\" said\\n Doctor.\\n  \"I don\\'t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be\\npitted against you to-night. Is  teaboard still there, Lucie? I\\ncan\\'t see.\"\\n  \"Of course, it has been kept for you.\"\\n  \"Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?\"\\n  \"And sleeping soundly.\"\\n  \"That\\'s right; all safe and well! I don\\'t know why anything should\\nbe otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so\\nput out all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear!\\nThank ye. Now, come and take your place in  circle, and let us\\nsit quiet, and hear  echoes about which you have your theory.\"\\n  \"Not a theory; it was a fancy.\"\\n  \"A fancy, then, my wise pet,\" said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand.\\n\"They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear\\nthem!\\n\\n  Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into\\nanybody\\'s life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once\\nstained red,  footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as \\nlittle circle sat in  dark London window.\\n  Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of\\nscarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above \\nbillowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in  sun. A\\ntremendous roar arose from  throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest\\nof naked arms struggled in  air like shrivelled branches of trees\\nin a winter wind: all  fingers convulsively clutching at every\\nweapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from  depths\\nbelow, no matter how far off.\\n  Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began,\\nthrough what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a\\ntime, over  heads of  crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in\\n throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed- so\\nwere cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives,\\naxes, pikes, every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover\\nor devise. People who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves\\nwith bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places\\nin walls. Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever\\nstrain and at high-fever heat. Every living creature there held life\\nas of no account, and was demented with a passionate readiness to\\nsacrifice it.\\n  As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this\\nraging circled round Defarge\\'s wine-shop, and every human drop in\\n caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards  vortex where\\nDefarge himself, already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued\\norders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward,\\ndisarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in  thickest of\\n uproar.\\n  \"Keep near to me, Jacques Three,\" cried Defarge; \"and do you,\\nJacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at  head of as\\nmany of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?\"\\n  \"Eh, well! Here you see me!\" said madame, composed as ever, but\\nnot knitting to-day. Madame\\'s resolute right hand was occupied with an\\naxe, in place of  usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a\\npistol and a cruel knife.\\n  \"Where do you go, my wife?\"\\n  \"I go,\" said madame, \"with you at present. You shall see me at \\nhead of women, by-and-bye.\"\\n  \"Come, then!\" cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. \"Patriots and\\nfriends, we are ready! The Bastille!\"\\n  With a roar that sounded as if all  breath in France had been\\nshaped into  detested word,  living sea rose, wave on wave,\\ndepth on depth, and overflowed  city to that point. Alarm-bells\\nringing, drums beating,  sea raging and thundering on its new\\nbeach,  attack begun.\\n  Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great\\ntowers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through  fire and\\nthrough  smoke- in  fire and in  smoke, for  sea cast\\nhim up against a cannon, and on  instant he became a cannonier-\\nDefarge of  wineshop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce\\nhours.\\n  Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great\\ntowers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! \"Work,\\ncomrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One\\nThousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques, Jacques Five-and-Twenty\\nThousand; in  name of all  Angels or  Devils- which you\\nprefer- work!\" Thus Defarge of  wine-shop, still at his gun,\\nwhich had long grown hot.\\n  \"To me, women!\" cried madame his wife. \"What! We can kill as well as\\n men when  place is taken!\" And to her, with a shrill thirsty\\ncry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and\\nrevenge.\\n  Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still  deep ditch, \\nsingle drawbridge,  massive stone walls, and  eight great\\ntowers. Slight displacements of  raging sea, made by  falling\\nwounded. Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet\\nstraw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions,\\nshrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and\\nrattle, and  furious sounding of  living sea; but, still \\ndeep ditch, and  single drawbridge, and  massive stone walls,\\nand  eight great towers, and still Defarge of  wine-shop at\\nhis gun, grown doubly hot by  service of Four fierce hours.\\n  A white flag from within  fortress, and a parley- this dimly\\nperceptible through  raging storm, nothing audible in it-\\nsuddenly  sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge\\nof  wine-shop over  lowered drawbridge, past  massive stone\\nouter walls, in among  eight great towers surrendered!\\n  So resistless was  force of  ocean bearing him on, that even\\nto draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he\\nhad been struggling in  surf at  South Sea, until he was\\nlanded in  outer courtyard of  Bastille. There, against an angle\\nof a wall, he made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was\\nnearly at his side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women,\\nwas visible in  inner distance, and her knife was in her hand.\\nEverywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal\\nbewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious dumb-show.\\n  \"The Prisoners!\"\\n  \"The Records!\"\\n  \"The secret cells!\"\\n  \"The instruments of torture!\"\\n  \"The Prisoners!\"\\n  Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, \"The\\nPrisoners!\" was  cry most taken up by  sea that rushed in, as if\\nthere were an eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When\\n foremost billows rolled past, bearing  prison officers with\\nthem, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook\\nremained undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on  breast of\\none of these men- a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in\\nhis hand- separated him from  rest, and got him between himself and\\n wall.\\n  \"Show me  North Tower!\" said Defarge. \"Quick!\"\\n  \"I will faithfully,\" replied  man, \"if you will come with me. But\\nthere is no one there.\"\\n  \"What is  meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?\" asked\\nDefarge. \"Quick!\"\\n  \"The meaning, monsieur?\"\\n  \"Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean\\nthat shall strike you dead?\"\\n  \"Kill him!\" croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.\\n  \"Monsieur, it is a cell.\"\\n  \"Show it me!\"\\n  \"Pass this way, then.\"\\n  Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently\\ndisappointed by  dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to\\npromise bloodshed, held by Defarge\\'s arm as he held by \\nturnkey\\'s. Their three heads had been close together during this brief\\ndiscourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one\\nanother, even then: so tremendous was  noise of  living ocean,\\nin its irruption into  Fortress, and its inundation of  courts\\nand passages and staircases. All around outside, too, it beat \\nwalls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial\\nshouts of tumult broke and leaped into  air like spray.\\n  Through gloomy vaults where  light of day had never shone, past\\nhideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,\\nand again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry\\nwaterfalls than staircases, Defarge,  turnkey, and Jacques Three,\\nlinked hand and arm, went with all  speed they could make. Here and\\nthere, especially at first,  inundation started on them and swept\\nby; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing\\nup a tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by  massive thickness\\nof walls and arches,  storm within  fortress and without was\\nonly audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if  noise out of\\nwhich they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.\\n  The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock,\\nswung  door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and\\npassed in:\\n  \"One hundred and five, North Tower!\"\\n  There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in  wall,\\nwith a stone screen before it, so that  sky could be only seen by\\nstooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred\\nacross, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes\\non  hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There\\nwere  four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.\\n  \"Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,\"\\nsaid Defarge to  turnkey.\\n  The man obeyed, and Defarge followed  light closely with his\\neyes.\\n  \"Stop!- Look here, Jacques!\"\\n  \"A. M.!\" croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.\\n  \"Alexandre Manette,\" said Defarge in his ear, following \\nletters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder.\\n\"And here he wrote \\'a poor physician.\\' And it was he, without doubt,\\nwho scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A\\ncrowbar? Give it me!\"\\n  He had still  linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a\\nsudden exchange of  two instruments, and turning on \\nworm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.\\n  \"Hold  light higher!\" he said, wrathfully, to  turnkey.\\n\"Look among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my\\nknife,\" throwing it to him; \"rip open that bed, and search \\nstraw. Hold  light higher, you!\"\\n  With a menacing look at  turnkey he crawled upon  hearth, and,\\npeering up  chimney, struck and prised at its sides with \\ncrowbar, and worked at  iron grating across it. In a few minutes,\\nsome mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face\\nto avoid; and in it, and in  old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in\\n chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he\\ngroped with a cautious touch.\\n  \"Nothing in  wood, and nothing in  straw, Jacques?\"\\n  \"Nothing.\"\\n  Let us collect them together, in  middle of  cell. So! Light\\nthem, you!\\n  The turnkey fired  little pile, which blazed high and hot.\\nStooping again to come out at  low-arched door, they left it\\nburning, and retraced their way to  courtyard; seeming to recover\\ntheir sense of hearing as they came down, until they were in \\nraging flood once more.\\n  They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself.\\nSaint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in\\n guard upon  governor who had defended  Bastille and shot \\npeople. Otherwise,  governor would not be marched to  Hotel de\\nVille for judgment. Otherwise,  governor would escape, and \\npeople\\'s blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of\\nworthlessness) be unavenged.\\n  In  howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to\\nencompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red\\ndecoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a\\nwoman\\'s. \"See, there is my husband!\" she cried, pointing him out. \"See\\nDefarge!\" She stood immovable close to  grim old officer, and\\nremained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him\\nthrough  streets, as Defarge and  rest bore him along;\\nremained immovable close to him when he was got near his\\ndestination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable\\nclose to him when  long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell\\nheavy; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it, that,\\nsuddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her\\ncruel knife-long ready-hewed off his head.\\n  The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible\\nidea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do.\\nSaint Antoine\\'s blood was up, and  blood of tyranny and\\ndomination by  iron hand was down- down on  steps of  Hotel\\nde Ville where  governor\\'s body lay- down on  sole of  shoe\\nof Madame Defarge where she had trodden on  body to steady it for\\nmutilation. \"Lower  lamp yonder!\" cried Saint Antoine, after\\nglaring round for a new means of death; \"here is one of his soldiers\\nto be left on guard!\" The swinging sentinel was posted, and  sea\\nrushed on.\\n  The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive\\nupheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and\\nwhose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently\\nswaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in \\nfurnaces of suffering until  touch of pity could make no mark on\\nthem.\\n  But, in  ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression\\nwas in vivid life, there were two groups of faces- each seven in\\nnumber- so fixedly contrasting with  rest, that never did sea\\nroll which bore more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of\\nprisoners, suddenly released by  storm that had burst their tomb,\\nwere carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and\\namazed, as if  Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around\\nthem were lost spirits. Other seven faces there were, carried\\nhigher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes\\nawaited  Last Day. Impassive faces, yet with a suspended- not an\\nabolished- expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as\\nhaving yet to raise  dropped lids of  eyes, and bear witness\\nwith  bloodless lips, \"THOU DIDST IT!\"\\n  Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes,  keys of \\naccursed fortress of  eight strong towers, some discovered\\nletters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of\\nbroken hearts, such, and such-like,  loudly echoing footsteps of\\nSaint Antoine escort through  Paris streets in mid-July, one\\nthousand seven hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat  fancy\\nof Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they\\nare headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in  years so long after \\nbreaking of  cask at Defarge\\'s wine-shop door, they are not\\neasily purified when once stained red.\\n  XXII\\n  THE SEA STILL RISES\\n\\n  HAGGARD SAINT ANTOINE had had only one exultant week, in which to\\nsoften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he\\ncould, with  relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when\\nMadame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over \\ncustomers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for  great\\nbrotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely\\nchary of trusting themselves to  saint\\'s mercies. The lamps\\nacross his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.\\n  Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in  morning light and\\nheat, contemplating  wine-shop and  street. In both, there\\nwere several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with\\na manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest\\nnightcap, awry on  wretchedest head, had this crooked\\nsignificance in it: \"I know how hard it has grown for me,  wearer\\nof this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has\\ngrown for me,  wearer of this, to destroy life in you?\" Every\\nlean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always\\nready for it now, that it could strike. The fingers of  knitting\\nwomen were vicious, with  experience that they could tear. There\\nwas a change in  appearance of Saint Antoine;  image had been\\nhammering into this for hundreds of years, and  last finishing\\nblows had told mightily on  expression.\\n  Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as\\nwas to be desired in  leader of  Saint Antoine women. One of her\\nsisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a\\nstarved grocer, and  mother of two children withal, this lieutenant\\nhad already earned  complimentary name of The Vengeance.\\n  \"Hark!\" said The Vengeance. \"Listen, then! Who comes?\"\\n  As if a train of powder laid from  outermost bound of Saint\\nAntoine Quarter to  wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a\\nfast-spreading murmur came rushing along.\\n  \"It is Defarge,\" said madame. \"Silence, patriots!\"\\n  Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked\\naround him! \"Listen, everywhere!\" said madame again. \"Listen to him!\\nDefarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open\\nmouths, formed outside  door; all those within  wine-shop had\\nsprung to their feet.\\n  \"Say then, my husband. What is it?\"\\n  \"News from  other world!\"\\n  \"How, then?\" cried madame, contemptuously. \"The other world?\"\\n  \"Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told  famished people\\nthat they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?\"\\n  \"Everybody!\" from all throats.\\n  \"The news is of him. He is among us!\"\\n  \"Among us!\" from  universal throat again. \"And dead?\"\\n  \"Not dead! He feared us so much- and with reason- that he caused\\nhimself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But\\nthey have found him alive, hiding in  country, and have brought him\\nin. I have seen him but now, on his way to  Hotel de Ville, a\\nprisoner. I have said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! Had he\\nreason?\"\\n  Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had\\nnever known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if\\nhe could have heard  answering cry.\\n  A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked\\nsteadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and  jar of a\\ndrum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind  counter.\\n  \"Patriots!\" said Defarge, in a determined voice, \"are we ready?\"\\n  Instantly Madame Defarge\\'s knife was in her girdle;  drum was\\nbeating in  streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by\\nmagic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging\\nher arms about her head like all  forty Furies at once, was tearing\\nfrom house to house, rousing  women.\\n  The men were terrible, in  bloody-minded anger with which they\\nlooked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring\\ndown into  streets; but,  women were a sight to chill \\nboldest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty\\nyielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching\\non  bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming\\nhair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with \\nwildest cries and actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon\\ntaken, my mother! Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score\\nof others ran into  midst of these, beating their breasts,\\ntearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told \\nstarving people they might eat grass! Foulon who told my old father\\nthat he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him! Foulon who\\ntold my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts where dry with\\nwant! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me,\\nmy dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these\\nstones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young\\nmen, Give us  blood of Foulon, Give us  head of Foulon, Give\\nus  heart of Foulon, Give us  body and soul of Foulon, Rend\\nFoulon to pieces, and dig him into  ground, that grass may grow\\nfrom him! With these cries, numbers of  women, lashed into blind\\nfrenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until\\nthey dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by  men\\nbelonging to them from being trampled under foot.\\n  Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was\\nat  Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine\\nknew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women\\nflocked out of  Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs\\nafter them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an\\nhour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine\\'s bosom but a few\\nold crones and  wailing children.\\n  No. They were all by that time choking  Hall of Examination where\\nthis old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into \\nadjacent open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The\\nVengeance, and Jacques Three, were in  first press, and at no great\\ndistance from him in  Hall.\\n  \"See!\" cried madame, pointing with her knife. \"See  old villain\\nbound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon\\nhis back. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!\" Madame\\nput her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.\\n  The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining  cause\\nof her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining\\nto others, and those to others,  neighbouring streets resounded\\nwith  clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of\\ndrawl, and  winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge\\'s\\nfrequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous\\nquickness, at a distance:  more readily, because certain men who\\nhad by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up  external\\narchitecture to look in from  windows, knew Madame Defarge well,\\nand acted as a telegraph between her and  crowd outside \\nbuilding.\\n  At length  sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of\\nhope or protection, directly down upon  old prisoner\\'s head. The\\nfavour was too much to bear; in an instant  barrier of dust and\\nchaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to  winds, and Saint\\nAntoine had got him!\\n  It was known directly, to  furthest confines of  crowd.\\nDefarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded \\nmiserable wretch in a deadly embrace- Madame Defarge had but\\nfollowed and turned her hand in one of  ropes with which he was\\ntied- The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and\\n men at  windows had not yet swooped into  Hall, like birds\\nof prey from their high perches- when  cry seemed to go up, all\\nover  city, \"Bring him out! Bring him to  lamp!\"\\n  Down, and up, and head foremost on  steps of  building; now,\\non his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and\\nstruck at, and stifled by  bunches of grass and straw that were\\nthrust into his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting,\\nbleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full\\nof vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as \\npeople drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead\\nwood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to  nearest\\nstreet corner where one of  fatal lamps swung, and there Madame\\nDefarge let him go- as a cat might have done to a mouse- and\\nsilently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while\\nhe besought her:  women passionately screeching at him all \\ntime, and  men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in\\nhis mouth. Once, he went aloft, and  rope broke, and they caught\\nhim shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and  rope broke, and they\\ncaught him shrieking; then,  rope was merciful, and held him, and\\nhis head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in  mouth for\\nall Saint Antoine to dance at  sight of.\\n  Nor was this  end of  day\\'s bad work, for Saint Antoine so\\nshouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on\\nhearing when  day closed in that  son-in-law of \\ndespatched, another of  people\\'s enemies and insulters, was\\ncoming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone.\\nSaint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him-\\nwould have torn him out of  breast of an army to bear Foulon\\ncompany- set his head and heart on pikes, and carried  three spoils\\nof  day, in Wolf-procession through  streets.\\n  Not before dark night did  men and women come back to \\nchildren, wailing and breadless. Then,  miserable bakers\\' shops\\nwere beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad\\nbread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they\\nbeguiled  time by embracing one another on  triumphs of  day,\\nand achieving them again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged\\npeople shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to\\nshine in high windows, and slender fires were made in  streets,\\nat which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their\\ndoors.\\n  Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of\\nmost other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused some\\nnourishment into  flinty viands, and struck some sparks of\\ncheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full\\nin  worst of  day, played gently with their meagre children; and\\nlovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and\\nhoped.\\n  It was almost morning, when Defarge\\'s wine-shop parted with its last\\nknot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in\\nhusky tones, while fastening  door:\\n  \"At last it is come, my dear!\"\\n  \"Eh well!\" returned madame. \"Almost.\"\\n  Saint Antoine slept,  Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept\\nwith her starved grocer, and  drum was at rest. The drum\\'s was\\n only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not\\nchanged. The Vengeance, as custodian of  drum, could have wakened\\nhim up and had  same speech out of him as before  Bastille fell,\\nor old Foulon was seized; not so with  hoarse tones of  men\\nand women in Saint Antoine\\'s bosom.\\n  XXIII\\n  FIRE RISES\\n\\n  THERE WAS a change on  village where  fountain fell, and where\\n mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of  stones on\\n highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold\\nhis poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The\\nprison on  crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers\\nto guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard \\nsoldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do- beyond this:\\nthat it would probably not be what he was ordered.\\n  Far and wide lay a rained country, yielding nothing but\\ndesolation. Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain,\\nwas as shrivelled and poor as  miserable people. Everything was\\nbowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences,\\ndomesticated animals, men, women, children, and  soil that bore\\nthem- all worn out.\\n  Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a\\nnational blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite\\nexample of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to\\nequal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or\\nother, brought things to this. Strange that Creation, designed\\nexpressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed\\nout! There must be something shortsighted in  eternal arrangements,\\nsurely! Thus it was, however; and  last drop of blood having\\nbeen extracted from  flints, and  last screw of  rack\\nhaving been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now\\nturned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run\\naway from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.\\n  But, this was not  change on  village, and on many a village\\nlike it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it\\nand wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for\\n pleasures of  chase- now, found in hunting  people; now,\\nfound in hunting  beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made\\nedifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change\\nconsisted in  appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than\\nin  disappearance of  high caste, chiselled, and otherwise\\nbeautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur.\\n  For, in these times, as  mender of roads worked, solitary, in \\ndust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to\\ndust he must return, being for  most part too much occupied in\\nthinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat\\nif he had it- in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely\\nlabour, and viewed  prospect, he would see some rough figure\\napproaching on foot,  like of which was once a rarity in those\\nparts, but was now a frequent presence. As it advanced,  mender\\nof roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired\\nman, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were\\nclumsy even to  eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart,\\nsteeped in  mud and dust of many highways, dank with  marshy\\nmoisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with  thorns and leaves and\\nmoss of many byways through woods.\\n  Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in  July weather,\\nas he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as\\nhe could get from a shower of hail.\\n  The man looked at him, looked at  village in  hollow, at \\nmill, and at  prison on  crag. When he had identified these\\nobjects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that\\nwas just intelligible:\\n  \"How goes it, Jacques?\"\\n  \"All well, Jacques.\"\\n  \"Touch then!\"\\n  They joined hands, and  man sat down on  heap of stones.\\n  \"No dinner?\"\\n  \"Nothing but supper now,\" said  mender of roads, with a hungry\\nface.\\n  \"It is  fashion,\" growled  man. \"I meet no dinner anywhere.\"\\n  He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and\\nsteel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held\\nit from him and dropped something into it from between his finger\\nand thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.\\n  \"Touch then.\" It was  turn of  mender of roads to say it\\nthis time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.\\n  \"To-night?\" said  mender of roads.\\n  \"To-night,\" said  man, putting  pipe in his mouth.\\n  \"Where?\"\\n  \"Here.\"\\n  He and  mender of roads sat on  heap of stones looking\\nsilently at one another, with  hail driving in between them like\\na pigmy charge of bayonets, until  sky began to clear over \\nvillage.\\n  \"Show me!\" said  traveller then, moving to  brow of  hill.\\n  \"See!\" returned  mender of roads, with extended finger. \"You go\\ndown here, and straight through  street, and past  fountain--\"\\n  \"To  Devil with all that!\" interrupted  other, rolling his eye\\nover  landscape. \"I go through no streets and past no fountains.\\nWell?\"\\n  \"Well! About two leagues beyond  summit of that hill above \\nvillage.\"\\n  \"Good. When do you cease to work?\"\\n  \"At sunset.\"\\n  \"Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights\\nwithout resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a\\nchild. Will you wake me?\"\\n  \"Surely.\"\\n  The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped\\noff his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on  heap of\\nstones. He was fast asleep directly.\\n  As  road-mender plied his dusty labour, and  hail-clouds,\\nrolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were\\nresponded to by silver gleams upon  landscape,  little man\\n(who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated\\nby  figure on  heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned\\ntowards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have\\nsaid, to very poor account. The bronze face,  shaggy black hair and\\nbeard,  coarse woollen red cap,  rough medley dress of home-spun\\nstuff and hairy skins of beasts,  powerful frame attenuated by\\nspare living, and  sullen and desperate compression of  lips\\nin sleep, inspired  mender of roads with awe. The traveller had\\ntravelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and\\nbleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been\\nheavy to drag over  many long leagues, and his clothes were\\nchafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. Stooping down\\nbeside him,  road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in\\nhis breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms\\ncrossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips. Fortified towns\\nwith their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and\\ndrawbridges, seemed to  mender of roads, to be so much air as\\nagainst this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to \\nhorizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar\\nfigures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.\\n  The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of\\nbrightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to  pattering lumps\\nof dull ice on his body and  diamonds into which  sun changed\\nthem, until  sun was low in  west, and  sky was glowing.\\nThen,  mender of roads having got his tools together and all things\\nready to go down into  village, roused him.\\n  \"Good!\" said  sleeper, rising on his elbow. \"Two leagues beyond\\n summit of  hill?\"\\n  \"About.\"\\n  \"About. Good!\"\\n  The mender of roads went home, with  dust going on before him\\naccording to  set of  wind, and was soon at  fountain,\\nsqueezing himself in among  lean kine brought there to drink, and\\nappearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all \\nvillage. When  village had taken its poor supper, it did not\\ncreep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and\\nremained there. A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and\\nalso, when it gathered together at  fountain in  dark, another\\ncurious contagion of looking expectantly at  sky in one direction\\nonly. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of  place, became uneasy;\\nwent out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too;\\nglanced down from behind his chimneys at  darkening faces by \\nfountain below, and sent word to  sacristan who kept  keys of\\n church, that there might be need to ring  tocsin by-and-bye.\\n  The night deepened. The trees environing  old chateau, keeping\\nits solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they\\nthreatened  pile of building massive and dark in  gloom. Up\\n two terrace flights of steps  rain ran wildly, and beat at\\n great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy\\nrushes of wind went through  hall, among  old spears and knives,\\nand passed lamenting up  stairs, and shook  curtains of \\nbed where  last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South,\\nthrough  woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed \\nhigh grass and cracked  branches, striding on cautiously to come in\\n courtyard. Four lights broke out there, and moved away in\\ndifferent directions, and all was black again.\\n  But, not for long. Presently,  chateau began to make itself\\nstrangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were\\ngrowing Then, a flickering streak played behind  architecture of\\n front, picking out transparent places, and showing where\\nbalustrades, arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew\\nbroader and brighter. Soon, from a score of  great windows,\\nflames burst forth, and  stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.\\n  A faint murmur arose about  house from  few people who were\\nleft there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There\\nwas spurring and splashing through  darkness, and bridle was\\ndrawn in  space by  village fountain, and  horse in a foam\\nstood at Monsieur Gabelle\\'s door. \"Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!\"\\nThe tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there\\nwas none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular\\nfriends, stood with folded arms at  fountain, looking at  pillar\\nof fire in  sky. \"It must be forty feet high,\" said they, grimly;\\nand never moved.\\n  The rider from  chateau, and  horse in a foam, clattered\\naway through  village, and galloped up  stony steep, to \\nprison on  crag. At  gate, a group of officers were looking at\\n fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. \"Help, gentlemen-\\nofficers! The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from\\n flames by timely aid! Help, help!\" The officers looked towards \\nsoldiers who looked at  fire; gave no orders; and answered, with\\nshrugs and biting of lips, \"It must burn.\"\\n  As  rider rattled down  hill again and through  street, \\nvillage was illuminating. The mender of roads, and  two hundred and\\nfifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by  idea of\\nlighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in\\nevery dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,\\noccasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of\\nMonsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that\\nfunctionary\\'s part,  mender of roads, once so submissive to\\nauthority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires\\nwith, and that post-horses would roast.\\n  The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In  roaring and\\nraging of  conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from \\ninfernal regions, seemed to be blowing  edifice away. With \\nrising and failing of  blaze,  stone faces showed as if they\\nwere in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, \\nface with  two dints in  nose became obscured: anon struggled\\nout of  smoke again, as if it were  face of  cruel Marquis,\\nburning at  stake and contending with  fire.\\n  The chateau burned;  nearest trees, laid hold of by  fire,\\nscorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by  four fierce\\nfigures, begirt  blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten\\nlead and iron boiled in  marble basin of  fountain;  water\\nran dry;  extinguisher tops of  towers vanished like ice\\nbefore  heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame.\\nGreat rents and splits branched out in  solid walls, like\\ncrystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into \\nfurnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and\\nSouth, along  night-enshrouded roads, guided by  beacon they had\\nlighted, towards their next destination. The illuminated village had\\nseized hold of  tocsin, and, abolishing  lawful ringer, rang for\\njoy.\\n  Not only that; but  village, light-headed with famine, fire,\\nand bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to\\ndo with  collection of rent and taxes- though it was but a small\\ninstalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those\\nlatter days- became impatient for an interview with him, and,\\nsurrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal\\nconference. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door,\\nand retire to hold counsel with himself. The result of that conference\\nwas, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his\\nstack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in\\n(he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch\\nhimself head foremost over  parapet, and crush a man or two below.\\n  Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with \\ndistant chateau for fire and candle, and  beating at his door,\\ncombined with  joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an\\nill-omened lamp slung across  road before his posting-house gate,\\nwhich  village showed a lively inclination to displace in his\\nfavour. A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on \\nbrink of  black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which\\nMonsieur Gabelle had resolved! But,  friendly dawn appearing at\\nlast, and  rush- candles of  village guttering out,  people\\nhappily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life\\nwith him for that while.\\n  Within a hundred miles, and in  light of other fires, there\\nwere other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other\\nnights, whom  rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful\\nstreets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other\\nvillagers and townspeople less fortunate than  mender of roads\\nand his fellows, upon whom  functionaries and soldiery turned\\nwith success, and whom they strung up in their turn. But,  fierce\\nfigures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as\\nit would; and whosoever hung, fire burned. The altitude of  gallows\\nthat would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch\\nof mathematics, was able to calculate successfully.\\n  XXIV\\n  DRAWN TO THE LOADSTONE ROCK\\n\\n  IN SUCH RISINGS of fire and risings of sea-  firm earth shaken by\\n rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on\\n flow, higher and higher, to  terror and wonder of  beholders\\non  shore- three years of tempest were consumed. Three more\\nbirthdays of little Lucie had been woven by  golden thread into \\npeaceful tissue of  life of her home.\\n  Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to  echoes\\nin  corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard \\nthronging feet. For,  footsteps had become to their minds as \\nfootsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their\\ncountry declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible\\nenchantment long persisted in.\\n  Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from  phenomenon\\nof his not being, appreciated: of his being so little wanted in\\nFrance, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal\\nfrom it, and this life together. Like  fabled rustic who raised \\nDevil with infinite pains, and was so terrified at  sight of him\\nthat he could ask  Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so,\\nMonseigneur, after boldly reading  Lord\\'s Prayer backwards for a\\ngreat number of years, and performing many other potent spells for\\ncompelling  Evil One, no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he\\ntook to his noble heels.\\n  The shining Bull\\'s Eye of  Court was gone, or it would have\\nbeen  mark for a hurricane of national bullets It had never been\\na good eye to see with- had long had  mote in it of Lucifer\\'s\\npride, Sardanapalus\\'s luxury, and a mole\\'s blindness- but it had\\ndropped out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner\\ncircle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and\\ndissimulation, was all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been\\nbesieged in its Palace and \"suspended,\" when  last tidings came\\nover.\\n  The August of  year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was\\ncome, and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time\\nscattered far and wide.\\n  As was natural,  head-quarters and great gathering-place of\\nMonseigneur, in London, was Tellson\\'s Bank. Spirits are supposed to\\nhaunt  places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur\\nwithout a guinea haunted  spot where his guineas used to be.\\nMoreover, it was  spot to which such French intelligence as was\\nmost to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson\\'s was a\\nmunificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who\\nhad fallen from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen\\n coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation,\\nhad made provident remittances to Tellson\\'s, were always to be heard\\nof there by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every\\nnew-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson\\'s,\\nalmost as a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson\\'s\\nwas at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High\\nExchange; and this was so well known to  public, and \\ninquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellson\\'s\\nsometimes wrote  latest news out in a line or so and posted it in\\n Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.\\n  On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and\\nCharles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice.\\nThe penitential den once set apart for interviews with  House,\\nwas now  news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was\\nwithin half an hour or so of  time of closing.\\n  \"But, although you are  youngest man that ever lived,\" said\\nCharles Darnay, rather hesitating, \"I must still suggest to you--\"\\n  \"I understand. That I am too old?\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a\\ndisorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.\"\\n  \"My dear Charles,\" said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, \"you\\ntouch some of  reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is\\nsafe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow\\nof hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better\\nworth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it\\nwere not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send\\nsomebody from our House here to our House there, who knows  city\\nand  business, of old, and is in Tellson\\'s confidence. As to \\nuncertain travelling,  long journey, and  winter weather, if I\\nwere not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for \\nsake of Tellson\\'s, after all these years, who ought to be?\"\\n  \"I wish I were going myself,\" said Charles Darnay, somewhat\\nrestlessly, and Eke one thinking aloud.\\n  \"Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!\" exclaimed\\nMr. Lorry. \"You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman\\nborn? You are a wise counsellor.\"\\n  \"My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that \\nthought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) bas passed\\nthrough my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some\\nsympathy for  miserable people, and having abandoned something to\\nthem,\" he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, \"that one\\nmight be listened to, and might have  power to persuade to some\\nrestraint. Only last night, after you had left us, when I was\\ntalking to Lucie--\"\\n  \"When you were talking to Lucie,\" Mr. Lorry repeated. \"Yes. I wonder\\nyou are not ashamed to mention  name of Lucie! Wishing you were\\ngoing to France at this time of day!\"\\n  \"However, I am not going,\" said Charles Darnay, with a smile. \"It is\\nmore to  purpose that you say you are.\"\\n  \"And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,\" Mr.\\nLorry glanced at  distant House, and lowered his voice, \"you can\\nhave no conception of  difficulty with which our business is\\ntransacted, and of  peril in which our books and papers over yonder\\nare involved. The Lord above knows what  compromising\\nconsequences would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents\\nwere seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know,\\nfor who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked\\nto-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these with  least\\npossible delay, and  burying of them, or otherwise getting of\\nthem out of harm\\'s way, is within  power (without loss of\\nprecious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall I\\nhang back, when Tellson\\'s knows this and says this- Tellson\\'s, whose\\nbread I have eaten these sixty years- because I am a little stiff\\nabout  joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers\\nhere!\"\\n  \"How I admire  gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.\"\\n  \"Tut! Nonsense, sir!- And, my dear Charles,\" said Mr. Lorry,\\nglancing at  House again, \"you are to remember, that getting things\\nout of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to\\nan impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day\\nbrought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not\\nbusiness-like to whisper it, even to you), by  strangest bearers\\nyou can imagine, every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single\\nhair as he passed  Barriers. At another time, our parcels would\\ncome and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now,\\neverything is stopped.\"\\n  \"And do you really go to-night?\"\\n  \"I really go to-night, for  case has become too pressing to admit\\nof delay.\"\\n  \"And do you take no one with you?\"\\n  \"All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have\\nnothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has\\nbeen my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am\\nused to him. Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an\\nEnglish bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at\\nanybody who touches his master.\"\\n  \"I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and\\nyouthfulness.\"\\n  \"I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this\\nlittle commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson\\'s proposal to\\nretire and live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about\\ngrowing old.\"\\n  This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry\\'s usual desk, with\\nMonseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he\\nwould do to avenge himself on  rascal-people before long. It was\\ntoo much  way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and\\nit was much too much  way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of\\nthis terrible Revolution as if it were  only harvest ever known\\nunder  skies that had not been sown- as if nothing had ever been\\ndone, or omitted to be done, that had led to it- as if observers of\\n wretched millions in France, and of  misused and perverted\\nresources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it\\ninevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded\\nwhat they saw. Such vapouring, combined with  extravagant plots\\nof Monseigneur for  restoration of a state of things that had\\nutterly exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as\\nitself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane\\nman who knew  truth. And it was such vapouring all about his\\nears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added\\nto a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles\\nDarnay restless, and which still kept him so.\\n  Among  talkers, was Stryver, of  King\\'s Bench Bar, far on\\nhis way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on  theme:\\nbroaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing  people up and\\nexterminating them from  face of  earth, and doing without them:\\nand for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to \\nabolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on  tails of  race.\\nHim, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay\\nstood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and\\nremaining to interpose his word, when  thing that was to be, went\\non to shape itself out.\\n  The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened\\nletter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of \\nperson to whom it was addressed? The House laid  letter down so\\nclose to Darnay that he saw  direction-  more quickly because it\\nwas his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran:\\n  \"Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore  Marquis St. Evremonde, of\\nFrance. Confided to  cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,\\nLondon, England.\"\\n  On  marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent\\nand express request to Charles Darnay, that  secret of this name\\nshould be- unless he,  Doctor, dissolved  obligation- kept\\ninviolate between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own\\nwife had no suspicion of  fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.\\n  \"No,\" said Mr. Lorry, in reply to  House; \"I have referred it,\\nI think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this\\ngentleman is to be found.\"\\n  The hands of  clock verging upon  hour of closing  Bank,\\nthere was a general set of  current of talkers past Mr. Lorry\\'s\\ndesk. He held  letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at\\nit, in  person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and\\nMonseigneur looked at it in  person of that plotting and\\nindignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something\\ndisparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning  Marquis\\nwho was not to be found.\\n  \"Nephew, I believe- but in any case degenerate successor- of \\npolished Marquis who was murdered,\" said one. \"Happy to say, I never\\nknew him.\"\\n  \"A craven who abandoned his post,\" said another- this Monseigneur\\nhad been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a\\nload of hay- \"some years ago.\"\\n  \"Infected with  new doctrines,\" said a third, eyeing \\ndirection through his glass in passing; \"set himself in opposition\\nto  last Marquis, abandoned  estates when he inherited them, and\\nleft them to  ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope,\\nas he deserves.\"\\n  \"Hey?\" cried  blatant Stryver. \"Did he though? Is that  sort\\nof fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D-n  fellow!\"\\n  Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver\\non  shoulder, and said:\\n  \"I know  fellow.\"\\n  \"Do you, by Jupiter?\" said Stryver. \"I am sorry for it.\"\\n  \"Why, Mr. Darnay? D\\'ye hear what he did? Don\\'t ask, why, in these\\ntimes.\"\\n  \"But I do ask why?\"\\n  \"Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to\\nbear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,\\nwho, infected by  most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry\\nthat ever was known, abandoned his property to  vilest scum of\\n earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am\\nsorry that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I\\'ll\\nanswer you. I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in\\nsuch a scoundrel. That\\'s why.\"\\n  Mindful of  secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself,\\nand said: \"You may not understand  gentleman.\"\\n  \"I understand how to put you in a corner, Mr. Darnay,\" said Bully\\nStryver, \"and I\\'ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I don\\'t\\nunderstand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also\\ntell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and\\nposition to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at  head of\\nthem. But, no, gentlemen,\" said Stryver, looking all round, and\\nsnapping his fingers, \"I know something of human nature, and I tell\\nyou that you\\'ll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself\\nto  mercies of such precious proteges. No, gentlemen; he\\'ll\\nalways show \\'em a clean pair of heels very early in  scuffle, and\\nsneak away.\"\\n  With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver\\nshouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst  general approbation\\nof his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at \\ndesk, in  general departure from  Bank.\\n  \"Will you take charge of  letter?\" said Mr. Lorry. \"You know\\nwhere to deliver it?\"\\n  \"I do.\"\\n  \"Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been\\naddressed here, on  chance of our knowing where to forward it,\\nand that it has been here some time?\"\\n  \"I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?\"\\n  \"From here, at eight.\"\\n  \"I will come back, to see you off.\"\\n  Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other\\nmen, Darnay made  best of his way into  quiet of  Temple,\\nopened  letter, and read it. These were its contents:\\n\\n                               \"Prison of  Abbaye, Paris.\\n                                      \"June 21, 1792.\\n  \"MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.\\n  \"After having long been in danger of my life at  hands of \\nvillage, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and\\nbrought a long journey on foot to Paris. On  road I have suffered a\\ngreat deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed- razed to \\nground.\\n  \"The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore \\nMarquis, and for which I shall be summoned before  tribunal, and\\nshall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell\\nme, treason against  majesty of  people, in that I have acted\\nagainst them for an emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have\\nacted for them, and not against, according to your commands. It is\\nin vain I represent that, before  sequestration of emigrant\\nproperty, I had remitted  imposts they had ceased to pay; that I\\nhad collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process. The only\\nresponse is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that\\nemigrant?\\n  \"Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore  Marquis, where is that\\nemigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he\\nnot come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore  Marquis,\\nI send my desolate cry across  sea, hoping it may perhaps reach\\nyour ears through  great bank of Tilson known at Paris!\\n  \"For  love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of  honour of\\nyour noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore  Marquis, to\\nsuccour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you.\\nOh Monsieur heretofore  Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!\\n  \"From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer\\nand nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore \\nMarquis,  assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.\\n                                     \"Your afflicted,\\n                                                 \"GABELLE.\"\\n\\n  The latent uneasiness in Darnay\\'s mind was roused to vigourous\\nlife by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose\\nonly crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so\\nreproachfully in  face, that, as he walked to and fro in  Temple\\nconsidering what to do, he almost hid his face from  passers-by.\\n  He knew very well, that in his horror of  deed which had\\nculminated  bad deeds and bad reputation of  old family house,\\nin his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in  aversion with\\nwhich his conscience regarded  crumbling fabric that he was\\nsupposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well,\\nthat in his love for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place,\\nthough by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and\\nincomplete. He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out\\nand supervised it, and that he had meant to do it, and that it had\\nnever been done.\\n  The happiness of his own chosen English home,  necessity of being\\nalways actively employed,  swift changes and troubles of  time\\nwhich had followed on one another so fast, that  events of this\\nweek annihilated  immature plans of last week, and  events of\\n week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to\\n force of these circumstances he had yielded:- not without\\ndisquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance.\\nThat he had watched  times for a time of action, and that they\\nhad shifted and struggled until  time had gone by, and  nobility\\nwere trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their\\nproperty was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very\\nnames were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be\\nto any new authority in France that might impeach him for it.\\n  But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so\\nfar from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had\\nrelinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no\\nfavour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own\\nbread. Monsieur Gabelle had held  impoverished and involved\\nestate on written instructions, to spare  people, to give them what\\nlittle there was to give- such fuel as  heavy creditors would let\\nthem have in  winter, and such produce as could be saved from \\nsame grip in  summer- and no doubt he had put  fact in plea\\nand proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now.\\n  This favoured  desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to\\nmake, that he would go to Paris.\\n  Yes. Like  mariner in  old story,  winds and streams had\\ndriven him within  influence of  Loadstone Rock, and it was\\ndrawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before\\nhis mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to\\n terrible attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims\\nwere being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments,\\nand that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they,\\nwas not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert\\n claims of mercy and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled,\\nand half reproaching him, be had been brought to  pointed\\ncomparison of himself with  brave old gentleman in whom duty was so\\nstrong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly\\nfollowed  sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly,\\nand those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old\\nreasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle\\'s letter:  appeal of an\\ninnocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and\\ngood name.\\n  His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.\\n  Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on,\\nuntil he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The\\nintention with which he had done what he had done, even although he\\nhad left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that\\nwould be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself\\nto assert it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so\\noften  sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and\\nhe even saw himself in  illusion with some influence to guide\\nthis raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.\\n  As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that\\nneither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.\\nLucie should be spared  pain of separation; and her father,\\nalways reluctant to turn his thoughts towards  dangerous ground\\nof old, should come to  knowledge of  step, as a step taken, and\\nnot in  balance of suspense and doubt. How much of \\nincompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through\\n painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in\\nhis mind, he did not discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too,\\nhad had its influence in his course.\\n  He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time\\nto return to Tellson\\'s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he\\narrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he\\nmust say nothing of his intention now.\\n  A carriage with post-horses was ready at  Bank door, and Jerry\\nwas booted and equipped.\\n  \"I have delivered that letter,\" said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \"I\\nwould not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but\\nperhaps you will take a verbal one?\"\\n  \"That I will, and readily,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"if it is not\\ndangerous.\"\\n  \"Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in  Abbaye.\"\\n  \"What is his name?\" said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his\\nhand.\\n  \"Gabelle.\"\\n  \"Gabelle. And what is  message to  unfortunate Gabelle in\\nprison?\"\\n  \"Simply, \\'that he has received  letter, and will come.\\'\"\\n  \"Any time mentioned?\"\\n  \"He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\"\\n  \"Any person mentioned?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,\\nand went out with him from  warm atmosphere of  old Bank, into\\n misty air of Fleet-street. \"My love to Lucie, and to little\\nLucie,\" said Mr. Lorry at parting, \"and take precious care of them\\ntill I come back.\" Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully\\nsmiled, as  carriage rolled away.\\n  That night- it was  fourteenth of August- he sat up late, and\\nwrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining  strong\\nobligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length,\\n reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become\\ninvolved in no personal danger there;  other was to  Doctor,\\nconfiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on\\n same topics with  strongest assurances. To both, he wrote\\nthat he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately\\nafter his arrival.\\n  It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with  first\\nreservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter\\nto preserve  innocent deceit of which they were profoundly\\nunsuspicious. But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and\\nbusy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been\\nhalf moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything\\nwithout her quiet aid), and  day passed quickly. Early in \\nevening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake,\\npretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement\\ntook him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so\\nhe emerged into  heavy mist of  heavy streets, with a heavier\\nheart.\\n  The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all \\ntides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left\\nhis two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour\\nbefore midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his\\njourney. \"For  love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of \\nhonour of your noble name!\" was  poor prisoner\\'s cry with which\\nhe strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on\\nearth behind him, and floated away for  Loadstone Rock.\\n\\n                 THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.\\n                                 BOOK THE THIRD\\n                              THE TRACK OF A STORM\\n  I\\n  IN SECRET\\n\\n  THE TRAVELLER fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris\\nfrom England in  autumn of  year one thousand seven hundred\\nand ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and\\nbad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though \\nfallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in\\nall his glory; but,  changed times were fraught with other\\nobstacles than these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its\\nband of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most\\nexplosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers,\\ncross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their\\nnames in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or\\nstopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or\\nfancy deemed best for  dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of\\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.\\n  A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when\\nCharles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country\\nroads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a\\ngood citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his\\njourney\\'s end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common\\nbarrier dropped across  road behind him, but he knew it to be\\nanother iron door in  series that was barred between him and\\nEngland. The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had\\nbeen taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a\\ncage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.\\n  This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on  highway\\ntwenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a\\nday, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and\\nstopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in\\ncharge. He had been days upon his journey in France alone, when he\\nwent to bed tired out, in a little town on  high road, still a long\\nway from Paris.\\n  Nothing but  production of  afflicted Gabelle\\'s letter from\\nhis prison of  Abbaye would have got him on so far. His\\ndifficulty at  guard-house in this small place had been such,\\nthat he felt his journey to have come to a crisis. And he was,\\ntherefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself\\nawakened at  small inn to which he had been remitted until morning,\\nin  middle of  night.\\n  Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in\\nrough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on \\nbed.\\n  \"Emigrant,\" said  functionary, \"I am going to send you on to\\nParis, under an escort.\"\\n  \"Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could\\ndispense with  escort.\"\\n  \"Silence!\" growled a red-cap, striking at  coverlet with \\nbutt-end of his musket. \"Peace, aristocrat!\"\\n  \"It is as  good patriot says,\" observed  timid functionary.\\n\"You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort- and must pay for it.\"\\n  \"I have no choice,\" said Charles Darnay.\\n  \"Choice! Listen to him!\" cried  same scowling red-cap. \"As if\\nit was not a favour to be protected from  lamp-iron!\"\\n  \"It is always as  good patriot says,\" observed  functionary.\\n\"Rise and dress yourself, emigrant.\"\\n  Darnay complied, and was taken back to  guard-house, where\\nother patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping,\\nby a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and\\nhence he started with it on  wet, wet roads at three o\\'clock in \\nmorning.\\n  The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured\\ncockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on\\neither side of him.\\n  The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached\\nto his bridle,  end of which one of  patriots kept girded\\nround his wrist. In this state they set forth with  sharp rain\\ndriving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over \\nuneven town pavement, and out upon  mire-deep roads. In this\\nstate they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all\\n mire-deep leagues that lay between them and  capital.\\n  They travelled in  night, halting an hour or two after\\ndaybreak, and lying by until  twilight fell. The escort were so\\nwretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and\\nthatched their ragged shoulders to keep  wet off. Apart from \\npersonal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such\\nconsiderations of present danger as arose from one of  patriots\\nbeing chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly,\\nCharles Darnay did not allow  restraint that was laid upon him to\\nawaken any serious fears in his breast; for, be reasoned with\\nhimself that it could have no reference to  merits of an individual\\ncase that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by\\n prisoner in  Abbaye, that were not yet made.\\n  But when they came to  town of Beauvais- which they did at\\neventide, when  streets were filled with people- he could not\\nconceal from himself that  aspect of affairs was very alarming.\\nAn ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of  posting-yard, and\\nmany voices called out loudly, \"Down with  emigrant!\"\\n  He stopped in  act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,\\nresuming it as his safest place, said:\\n  \"Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my\\nown will?\"\\n  \"You are a cursed emigrant,\" cried a farrier, making at him in a\\nfurious manner through  press, hammer in hand; \"and you are a\\ncursed aristocrat!\"\\n  The postmaster interposed himself between this man and  rider\\'s\\nbridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, \"Let\\nhim be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.\"\\n  \"Judged!\" repeated  farrier, swinging his hammer. \"Ay! and\\ncondemned as a traitor.\" At this  crowd roared approval.\\n  Checking  postmaster, who was for turning his horse\\'s head to \\nyard ( drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on,\\nwith  line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could\\nmake his voice heard:\\n  \"Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a\\ntraitor.\"\\n  \"He lies!\" cried  smith. \"He is a traitor since  decree. His\\nlife is forfeit to  people. His cursed life is not his own!\"\\n  At  instant when Darnay saw a rush in  eyes of  crowd,\\nwhich another instant would have brought upon him,  postmaster\\nturned his horse into  yard,  escort rode in close upon his\\nhorse\\'s flanks, and  postmaster shut and barred  crazy double\\ngates. The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and \\ncrowd groaned; but, no more was done.\\n  \"What is this decree that  smith spoke of?\" Darnay asked \\npostmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in  yard.\\n\"Truly, a decree for selling  property of emigrants.\"\\n  \"When passed?\"\\n  \"On  fourteenth.\"\\n  \"The day I left England!\"\\n  \"Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be\\nothers- if there are not already- banishing all emigrants, and\\ncondemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said\\nyour life was not your own.\"\\n  \"But there are no such decrees yet?\"\\n  \"What do I know!\" said  postmaster, shrugging his shoulders;\\n\"there may be, or there will be. It is all  same. What would you\\nhave?\"\\n  They rested on some straw in a loft until  middle of  night,\\nand then rode forward again when all  town was asleep. Among \\nmany wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild\\nride unreal, not  least was  seeming rarity of sleep. After long\\nand lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of\\npoor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with\\nlights, and would find  people, in a ghostly manner in  dead\\nof  night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of\\nLiberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song. Happily,\\nhowever, there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it\\nand they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling\\nthrough  untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that\\nhad yielded no fruits of  earth that year, diversified by \\nblackened remains of burnt houses, and by  sudden emergence from\\nambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols\\non  watch on all  roads.\\n  Daylight at last found them before  wall of Paris. The barrier\\nwas closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.\\n  \"Where are  papers of this prisoner?\" demanded a resolute-looking\\nman in authority, who was summoned out by  guard.\\n  Naturally struck by  disagreeable word, Charles Darnay\\nrequested  speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller\\nand French citizen, in charge of an escort which  disturbed state\\nof  country had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.\\n  \"Where,\" repeated  same personage, without taking any heed of him\\nwhatever, \"are  papers of this prisoner?\"\\n  The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them.\\nCasting his eyes over Gabelle\\'s letter,  same personage in\\nauthority showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with\\na close attention.\\n  He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went\\ninto  guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside \\ngate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles\\nDarnay observed that  gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers\\nand patriots,  latter far outnumbering  former; and that while\\ningress into  city for peasants\\' carts bringing in supplies, and\\nfor similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for\\n homeliest people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and\\nwomen, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was\\nwaiting to issue forth; but,  previous identification was so\\nstrict, that they filtered through  barrier very slowly. Some of\\nthese people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that\\nthey lay down on  ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked\\ntogether, or loitered about. The red cap and tricolour cockade were\\nuniversal, both among men and women.\\n  When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these\\nthings, Darnay found himself confronted by  same man in\\nauthority, who directed  guard to open  barrier. Then he\\ndelivered to  escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for \\nescorted, and requested him to dismount. He did so, and  two\\npatriots, leading his tired horse, turned and rode away without\\nentering  city.\\n  He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common\\nwine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and\\nawake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping\\nand waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.\\nThe light in  guard-house, half derived from  waning oil-lamps\\nof  night, and half from  overcast day, was in a correspondingly\\nuncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and\\nan officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.\\n  \"Citizen Defarge,\" said he to Darnay\\'s conductor, as he took a\\nslip of paper to write on. \"Is this  emigrant Evremonde?\"\\n  \"This is  man.\"\\n  \"Your age, Evremonde?\"\\n  \"Thirty-seven.\"\\n  \"Married, Evremonde?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"Where married?\"\\n  \"In England.\"\\n  \"Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?\"\\n  \"In England.\"\\n  \"Without doubt. Your are consigned, Evremonde, to  prison of La\\nForce.\"\\n  \"Just Heaven!\" exclaimed Darnay. \"Under what law, and for what\\noffence?\"\\n  The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.\\n  \"We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were\\nhere.\" He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.\\n  \"I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in\\nresponse to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies\\nbefore you. I demand no more than  opportunity to do so without\\ndelay. Is not that my right?\"\\n  \"Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,\" was  stolid reply. The\\nofficer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he\\nhad written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with  words \"In\\nsecret.\"\\n  Defarge motioned with  paper to  prisoner that he must\\naccompany him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed\\npatriots attended them.\\n  \"Is it you,\" said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down \\nguardhouse steps and turned into Paris, \"who married  daughter of\\nDoctor Manette, once a prisoner in  Bastille that is no more?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.\\n  \"My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in  Quarter Saint\\nAntoine. Possibly you have heard of me.\"\\n  \"My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!\"\\n  The word \"wife\" seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge,\\nto say with sudden impatience, \"In  name of that sharp female\\nnewlyborn, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?\"\\n  \"You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is \\ntruth?\"\\n  \"A bad truth for you,\" said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows,\\nand looking straight before him.\\n  \"Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so\\nsudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a\\nlittle help?\"\\n  \"None.\" Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.\\n  \"Will you answer me a single question?\"\\n  \"Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.\"\\n \"In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some\\nfree communication with  world outside?\"\\n  \"You will see.\"\\n  \"I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of\\npresenting my case?\"\\n  \"You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly\\nburied in worse prisons, before now.\"\\n  \"But never by me, Citizen Defarge.\"\\n  Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a\\nsteady and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, \\nfainter hope there was- or so Darnay thought- of his softening in\\nany slight degree. He, therefore, made haste to say:\\n  \"It is of  utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even\\nbetter than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to\\ncommunicate to Mr. Lorry of Tellson\\'s Bank, an English gentleman who\\nis now in Paris,  simple fact, without comment, that I have been\\nthrown into  prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for\\nme?\"\\n  \"I will do,\" Defarge doggedly rejoined, \"nothing for you. My duty is\\nto my country and  People. I am  sworn servant of both,\\nagainst you. I will do nothing for you.\"\\n  Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his\\npride was touched besides. As they walked on in silnce, he could not\\nbut see how used  people were to  spectacle of prisoners passing\\nalong  streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few\\npassers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an\\naristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to\\nprison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes\\nshould be going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through\\nwhich they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was\\naddressing an excited audience on  crimes against  people, of\\n king and  royal family. The few words that he caught from\\nthis man\\'s lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that  king\\nwas in prison, and that  foreign ambassadors had one and all left\\nParis. On  road (except at Beauvais) he had heard absolutely\\nnothing. The escort and  universal watchfulness had completely\\nisolated him.\\n  That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had\\ndeveloped themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That\\nperils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and\\nfaster yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself\\nthat he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen\\n events of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark\\nas, imagined by  light of this later time, they would appear.\\nTroubled as  future was, it was  unknown future, and in its\\nobscurity there was ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and\\nnights long, which, within a few rounds of  clock, was to set a\\ngreat mark of blood upon  blessed garnering time of harvest, was as\\nfar out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years\\naway. The \"sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine,\" was\\nhardly known to him, or to  generality of people, by name. The\\nfrightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at\\nthat time in  brains of  doers. How could they have a place in\\n shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?\\n  Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel\\nseparation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed  likelihood, or\\n certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With\\nthis on his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison\\ncourtyard, he arrived at  prison of La Force.\\n  A man with a bloated face opened  strong wicket, to whom\\nDefarge presented \"The Emigrant Evremonde.\"\\n  \"What  Devil! How many more of them!\" exclaimed  man with\\n bloated face.\\n  Defarge took his receipt without noticing  exclamation, and\\nwithdrew, with his two fellow-patriots.\\n  \"What  Devil, I say again!\" exclaimed  gaoler, left with his\\nwife. \"How many more!\"\\n  The gaoler\\'s wife, being provided with no answer to  question,\\nmerely replied, \"One must have patience, my dear!\" Three turnkeys\\nwho entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed  sentiment, and\\none added, \"For  love of Liberty;\" which sounded in that place like\\nan inappropriate conclusion.\\n  The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and\\nwith a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon\\n noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all\\nsuch places that are ill cared for!\\n  \"In secret, too,\" grumbled  gaoler, looking at  written paper.\\n\"As if I was not already full to bursting!\"\\n  He stuck  paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay\\nawaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to\\nand fro in  strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat:\\nin either case detained to be imprinted on  memory of  chief and\\nhis subordinates.\\n  \"Come!\" said  chief, at length taking up his keys, \"come with me,\\nemigrant.\"\\n  Through  dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him\\nby corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind\\nthem, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with\\nprisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table,\\nreading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering;  men\\nwere for  most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up\\nand down  room.\\n  In  instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime\\nand disgrace,  new-comer recoiled from this company. But \\ncrowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once\\nrising to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to \\ntime, and with all  engaging graces and courtesies of life.\\n  So strangely clouded were these refinements by  prison manners\\nand gloom, so spectral did they become in  inappropriate squalor\\nand misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to\\nstand in a company of  dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, \\nghost of stateliness,  ghost of elegance,  ghost of pride, \\nghost of frivolity,  ghost of wit,  ghost of youth,  ghost of\\nage, all waiting their dismissal from  desolate shore, all\\nturning on him eyes that were changed by  death they had died in\\ncoming there.\\n  It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and \\nother gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to\\nappearance in  ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so\\nextravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming\\ndaughters who were there- with  apparitions of  coquette, \\nyoung beauty, and  mature woman delicately bred- that  inversion\\nof all experience and likelihood which  scene of shadows presented,\\nwas heightened to its utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely,  long\\nunreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these\\ngloomy shades!\\n  \"In  name of  assembled companions in misfortune,\" said a\\ngentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, \"I have\\n honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with\\nyou on  calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon\\nterminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is\\nnot so here, to ask your name and condition?\"\\n  Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave  required information, in\\nwords as suitable as he could find.\\n  \"But I hope,\" said  gentleman, following  chief gaoler with\\nhis eyes, who moved across  room, \"that you are not in secret?\"\\n  \"I do not understand  meaning of  term, but I have heard\\nthem say so.\"\\n  \"Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several\\nmembers of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has\\nlasted but a short time.\" Then he added, raising his voice, \"I\\ngrieve to inform  society- in secret.\"\\n  There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed \\nroom to a grated door where  gaoler awaited him, and many voices-\\namong which,  soft and compassionate voices of women were\\nconspicuous- gave him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at\\n grated door, to render  thanks of his heart; it closed under\\n gaoler\\'s hand; and  apparitions vanished from his sight for\\never.\\n  The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they\\nhad ascended forty steps ( prisoner of half an hour already counted\\nthem),  gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a\\nsolitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.\\n  \"Yours,\" said  gaoler.\\n  \"Why am I confined alone?\"\\n  \"How do I know!\"\\n  \"I can buy pen, ink, and paper?\"\\n  \"Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At\\npresent, you may buy your food, and nothing more.\"\\n  There were in  cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As\\n gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of  four\\nwalls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through  mind\\nof  prisoner leaning against  wall opposite to him, that this\\ngaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to\\nlook like a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When \\ngaoler was gone, he thought in  same wandering way, \"Now am I left,\\nas if I were dead.\" Stopping then, to look down at  mattress, he\\nturned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, \"And here in these\\ncrawling creatures is  first condition of  body after death.\"\\n \"Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five\\npaces by four and a half.\" The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,\\ncounting its measurement, and  roar of  city arose like\\nmuffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. \"He made\\nshoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.\" The prisoner counted \\nmeasurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from\\nthat latter repetition. \"The ghosts that vanished when  wicket\\nclosed. There was one among them,  appearance of a lady dressed\\nin black, who was leaning in  embrasure of a window, and she had\\na light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like * * * *\\nLet us ride on again, for God\\'s sake, through  illuminated villages\\nwith  people all awake! * * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he\\nmade shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and a half.\" With such scraps\\ntossing and rolling upward from  depths of his mind,  prisoner\\nwalked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and \\nroar of  city changed to this extent- that it still rolled in\\nlike muffled drums, but with  wall of voices that he knew, in \\nswell that rose above them.\\n  II\\n  THE GRINDSTONE\\n\\n  TELLSON\\'S BANK, established in  Saint Germain Quarter of Paris,\\nwas in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off\\nfrom  street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged\\nto a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from\\n troubles, in his own cook\\'s dress, and got across  borders. A\\nmere beast of  chase flying from hunters, he was still in his\\nmetempsychosis no other than  same Monseigneur,  preparation\\nof whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men\\nbesides  cook in question.\\n  Monseigneur gone, and  three strong men absolving themselves from\\n sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and\\nwilling to cut his throat on  altar of  dawning Republic one and\\nindivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death,\\nMonseigneur\\'s house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated.\\nFor, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that\\nfierce precipitation, that now upon  third night of  autumn\\nmonth of September, patriot emissaries of  law were in possession\\nof Monseigneur\\'s house, and had marked it with  tricolour, and were\\ndrinking brandy in its state apartments.\\n  A place of business in London like Tellson\\'s place of business in\\nParis, would soon have driven  House out of its mind and into \\nGazette. For, what would staid British responsibility and\\nrespectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard,\\nand even to a Cupid over  counter? Yet such things were.\\nTellson\\'s had whitewashed  Cupid, but he was still to be seen on\\n ceiling, in  coolest linen, aiming (as he very often does) at\\nmoney from morning to night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of\\nthis young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained\\nalcove in  rear of  immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass\\nlet into  wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in\\npublic on  slightest provocation. Yet, a French Tellson\\'s could get\\non with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as  times\\nheld together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his\\nmoney.\\n  What money would be drawn out of Tellson\\'s henceforth, and what\\nwould lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would\\ntarnish in Tellson\\'s hiding-places, while  depositors rusted in\\nprisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many\\naccounts with Tellson\\'s never to be balanced in this world, must be\\ncarried over into  next; no man could have said, that night, any\\nmore than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these\\nquestions. He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire ( blighted and\\nunfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and\\ncourageous face there was a deeper shade than  pendent lamp could\\nthrow, or any object in  room distortedly reflect- a shade of\\nhorror.\\n  He occupied rooms in  Bank, in his fidelity to  House of which\\nhe had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that\\nthey derived a kind of security from  patriotic occupation of \\nmain building, but  true-hearted old gentleman never calculated\\nabout that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he\\ndid his duty. On  opposite side of  courtyard, under a\\ncolonnade, was extensive standing for carriages- where, indeed, some\\ncarriages of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of  pillars were\\nfastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in  light of these,\\nstanding out in  open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly\\nmounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from\\nsome neighbouring smithy, or other workshop. Rising and looking out of\\nwindow at these harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to\\nhis seat by  fire. He had opened, not only  glass window, but\\n lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he\\nshivered through his frame.\\n  From  streets beyond  high wall and  strong gate, there\\ncame  usual night hum of  city, with now and then an\\nindescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted\\nsounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven.\\n  \"Thank God said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, \"that no one near and\\ndear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all\\nwho are in danger!\"\\n  Soon afterwards,  bell at  great gate sounded, and he thought,\\n\"They have come back!\" and sat listening. But, there was no loud\\nirruption into  courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard \\ngate clash again, and all was quiet.\\n  The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague\\nuneasiness respecting  Bank, which a great change would naturally\\nawaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got\\nup to go among  trusty people who were watching it, when his door\\nsuddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he\\nfell back in amazement.\\n  Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him,\\nand with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified,\\nthat it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly\\nto give force and power to it in this one passage of her life.\\n  \"What is this?\" cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \"What is\\n matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you\\nhere? What is it?\"\\n  With  look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she\\npanted out in his arms, imploringly, \"O my dear friend! My husband!\"\\n  \"Your husband, Lucie?\"\\n  \"Charles.\"\\n  \"What of Charles?\"\\n  \"Here.\"\\n  \"Here, in Paris?\"\\n  \"Has been here some days- three or four- I don\\'t know how many- I\\ncan\\'t collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here\\nunknown to us; he was stopped at  barrier, and sent to prison.\"\\n  The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at  same moment,\\n bell of  great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and\\nvoices came pouring into  courtyard.\\n  \"What is that noise?\" said  Doctor, turning towards  window.\\n  \"Don\\'t look!\" cried Mr. Lorry. \"Don\\'t look out! Manette, for your\\nlife, don\\'t touch  blind!\"\\n  The Doctor turned, with his hand upon  fastening of  window,\\nand said, with a cool, bold smile: \"My dear friend, I have a charmed\\nlife in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no\\npatriot in Paris- in Paris? In France- who, knowing me to have been\\na prisoner in  Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me\\nwith embraces, or carry me in triumph. My old pain has given me a\\npower that has brought us through  barrier, and gained us news of\\nCharles there, and brought us here. I knew it would be so; I knew I\\ncould help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.- What is that\\nnoise?\" His hand was again upon  window.\\n  \"Don\\'t look!\" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. \"No, Lucie,\\nmy dear, nor you!\" He got his arm round her, and held her. \"Don\\'t be\\nso terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no\\nharm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his\\nbeing in this fatal place. What prison is he in?\"\\n  \"La Force!\"\\n  \"La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable\\nin your life- and you were always both- you will compose yourself now,\\nto do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can\\nthink, or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your\\npart to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because\\nwhat I must bid you to do for Charles\\'s sake, is  hardest thing\\nto do of all. You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You\\nmust let me put you in a room at  back here. You must leave your\\nfather and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death\\nin  world you must not delay.\"\\n  \"I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can\\ndo nothing else than this. I know you are true.\"\\n  The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned\\n key; then, came hurrying back to  Doctor, and opened  window\\nand partly opened  window and partly opened  blind, and put\\nhis hand upon  Doctor\\'s arm, and looked out with him into \\ncourtyard.\\n  Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number,\\nor near enough, to fill  courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in\\nall. The people in possession of  house had let them in at \\ngate, and they had rushed in to work at  grindstone; it had\\nevidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient\\nand retired spot.\\n  But, such awful workers, and such awful work!\\n  The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were\\ntwo men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when \\nwhirlings of  grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible\\nand cruel than  visages of  wildest savages in their most\\nbarbarous disguise. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck\\nupon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and\\nsweaty, and all awry with bowling, and all staring and glaring with\\nbeastly excitement and want of sleep. As these ruffians turned and\\nturned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now\\nflung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their\\nmouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what\\nwith dropping wine, and what with  stream of sparks struck out of\\n stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. The eye\\ncould not detect one creature in  group free from  smear of\\nblood. Shouldering one another to get next at  sharpening-stone,\\nwere men stripped to  waist, with  stain all over their limbs\\nand bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with  stain upon those\\nrags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women\\'s lace and silk\\nand ribbon, with  stain dyeing those trifles through and through.\\nHatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened,\\nwere all red with it. Some of  hacked swords were tied to \\nwrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments\\nof dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of  one colour.\\nAnd as  frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from \\nstream of sparks and tore away into  streets,  same red hue\\nwas red in their frenzied eyes;- eyes which any unbrutalised\\nbeholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a\\nwell-directed gun.\\n  All this was seen in a moment, as  vision of a drowning man, or\\nof any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if\\nit were there. They drew back from  window, and  Doctor looked\\nfor explanation in his friend\\'s ashy face.\\n  \"They are,\" Mr. Lorry whispered  words, glancing fearfully\\nround at  locked room, \"murdering  prisoners. If you are sure of\\nwhat you say; if you really have  power you think you have- as I\\nbelieve you have- make yourself known to these devils, and get taken\\nto La Force. It may be too late, I don\\'t know, but let it not be a\\nminute later!\"\\n  Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of \\nroom, and was in  courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained  blind.\\n  His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and  impetuous\\nconfidence of his manner, as he put  weapons aside like water,\\ncarried him in an instant to  heart of  concourse at \\nstone. For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur,\\nand  unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,\\nsurrounded by all, and in  midst of a line of twenty men long,\\nall linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out\\nwith cries of- \"Live  Bastille prisoner! Help for  Bastille\\nprisoner\\'s kindred in La Force! Room for  Bastille prisoner in\\nfront there! Save  prisoner Evremonde at La Force!\" and a\\nthousand answering shouts.\\n  He closed  lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed \\nwindow and  curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her\\nfather was assisted by  people, and gone in search of her\\nhusband. He found her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never\\noccurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long\\ntime afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as \\nnight knew.\\n  Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on  floor at his\\nfeet, clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid  child down on\\nhis own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on  pillow beside\\nher pretty charge. O  long, long night, with  moans of \\npoor wife! And O  long, long night, with no return of her father\\nand no tidings!\\n  Twice more in  darkness  bell at  great gate sounded, and\\n irruption was repeated, and  grindstone whirled and spluttered.\\n\"What is it?\" cried Lucie, affrighted. \"Hush! The soldiers\\' swords are\\nsharpened there,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"The place is national property now,\\nand used as a kind of armoury, my love.\"\\n  Twice more in all; but,  last spell of work was feeble and\\nfitful. Soon afterwards  day began to dawn, and he softly\\ndetached himself from  clasping hand, and cautiously looked out\\nagain. A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded\\nsoldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising\\nfrom  pavement by  side of  grindstone, and looking about him\\nwith a vacant air. Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in \\nimperfect light one of  carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering\\nto that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at  door, and shut himself\\nup to take his rest on its dainty cushions.\\n  The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out\\nagain, and  sun was red on  courtyard. But,  lesser\\ngrindstone stood alone there in  calm morning air, with a red\\nupon it that  sun had never given, and would never take away.\\n  III\\n  THE SHADOW\\n\\n  ONE Of  first considerations which arose in  business mind\\nof Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:- that he had no\\nright to imperil Tellson\\'s by sheltering  wife of an emigrant\\nprisoner under  Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he\\nwould have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moment\\'s demur;\\nbut  great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business\\ncharge he was a strict man of business.\\n  At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding\\nout  wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in\\nreference to  safest dwelling-place in  distracted state of\\n city. But,  same consideration that suggested him, repudiated\\nhim; he lived in  most violent Quarter, and doubtless was\\ninfluential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.\\n  Noon coming, and  Doctor not returning, and every minute\\'s\\ndelay tending to compromise Tellson\\'s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie.\\nShe said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short\\nterm, in that Quarter, near  Banking-house. As there was no\\nbusiness objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all\\nwell with Charles, and he were to be released, he could not hope to\\nleave  city, Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and\\nfound a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where \\nclosed blinds in all  other windows of a high melancholy square\\nof buildings marked deserted homes.\\n  To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss\\nPross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had\\nhimself. He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that\\nwould bear considerable knocking on  head, and returned to his\\nown occupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear\\nupon them, and slowly and heavily  day lagged on with him.\\n  It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until  Bank closed.\\nHe was again alone in his room of  previous night, considering what\\nto do next, when be heard a foot upon  stair. In a few moments, a\\nman stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\\naddressed him by his name.\\n  \"Your servant,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Do you know me?\"\\n  He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five\\nto fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of\\nemphasis,  words:\\n  \"Do you know me?\"\\n  \"I have seen you somewhere.\"\\n  \"Perhaps at my wine-shop?\"\\n  Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: \"You come from\\nDoctor Manette?\"\\n  \"Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.\"\\n  \"And what says he? What does he send me?\"\\n  Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It\\nbore  words in  Doctor\\'s writing:\\n\\n  \"Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. I have\\nobtained  favour that  bearer has a short note from Charles to\\nhis wife. Let  bearer see his wife.\"\\n\\n  It was dated from La Force, within an hour.\\n  \"Will you accompany me,\" said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after\\nreading this note aloud, \"to where his wife resides?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" returned Defarge.\\n  Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and\\nmechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went\\ndown into  courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.\\n  \"Madame Defarge, surely!\" said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in\\nexactly  same attitude some seventeen years ago.\\n  \"It is she,\" observed her husband.\\n  \"Does Madame go with us?\" inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she\\nmoved as they moved.\\n  \"Yes. That she may be able to recognise  faces and know \\npersons. It is for their safety.\"\\n  Beginning to be strack by Defarge\\'s manner, Mr. Lorry looked\\ndubiously at him, and led  way. Both  women followed;  second\\nwoman being The Vengeance.\\n  They passed through  intervening streets as quickly as they\\nmight, ascended  staircase of  new domicile, were admitted by\\nJerry, and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport\\nby  tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped  hand\\nthat delivered his note- little thinking what it had been doing near\\nhim in  night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.\\n\\n  \"DEAREST,- Take courage. I am well, and your father has influence\\naround me. You cannot answer this. Kiss our child for me.\"\\n\\n  That was all  writing. It was so much, however, to her who\\nreceived it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed\\none of  hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving,\\nthankful, womanly action, but  hand made no response- dropped\\ncold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.\\n  There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She\\nstopped in  act of putting  note in her bosom, and, with her\\nhands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame\\nDefarge met  lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive\\nstare.\\n  \"My dear,\" said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \"there are\\nfrequent risings in  streets; and, although it is not likely they\\nwill ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has\\n power to protect at such times, to  end that she may know them-\\nthat she may identify them. I believe,\" said Mr. Lorry, rather halting\\nin his reassuring words, as  stony manner of an  three impressed\\nitself upon him more and more, \"I state  case, Citizen Defarge?\"\\n  Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a\\ngruff sound of acquiescence.\\n  \"You had better, Lucie,\" said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to\\npropitiate, by tone and manner, \"have  dear child here, and our\\ngood Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows\\nno French.\"\\n  The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than\\na match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and\\ndanger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The\\nVengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, \"Well, I am sure,\\nBoldface! I hope you are pretty well!\" She also bestowed a British\\ncough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of  two took much heed of\\nher.\\n  \"Is that his child?\" said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for\\n fust time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as\\nif it were  finger of Fate.\\n  \"Yes, madame,\" answered Mr. Lorry; \"this is our poor prisoner\\'s\\ndarling daughter, and only child.\"\\n  The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to\\nfall so threatening and dark on  child, that her mother\\ninstinctively kneeled on  ground beside her, and held her to her\\nbreast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed\\nthen to fall, threatening and dark, on both  mother and  child.\\n  \"It is enough, my husband,\" said Madame Defarge. \"I have seen\\nthem. We may go.\"\\n  But,  suppressed manner had enough of menace in it- not visible\\nand presented, but indistinct and withheld- to alarm Lucie into\\nsaying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge\\'s dress:\\n  \"You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You\\nwill help me to see him if you can?\"\\n  \"Your husband is not my business here,\" returned Madame Defarge,\\nlooking down at her with perfect composure. \"It is  daughter of\\nyour father who is my business here.\"\\n  \"For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child\\'s\\nsake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful.\\nWe are more afraid of you than of these others.\"\\n  Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her\\nhusband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and\\nlooking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.\\n  \"What is it that your husband says in that little letter?\" asked\\nMadame Defarge, with a lowering smile. \"Influence; he says something\\ntouching influence?\"\\n  \"That my father,\" said Lucie, hurriedly taking  paper from her\\nbreast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it,\\n\"has much influence around him.\"\\n  \"Surely it will release him!\" said Madame Defarge. \"Let it do so.\"\\n  \"As a wife and mother,\" cried Lucie, most earnestly, \"I implore\\nyou to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess,\\nagainst my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O\\nsister-woman, think of me. As a wife and mother!\"\\n  Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at  suppliant, and said,\\nturning to her friend The Vengeance:\\n  \"The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as\\nlittle as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?\\nWe have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept\\nfrom them, often enough? All our lives, we have seen our\\nsister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty,\\nnakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of\\nall kinds?\"\\n  \"We have seen nothing else,\" returned The Vengeance.\\n  \"We have borne this a long time,\" said Madame Defarge, turning her\\neyes again upon Lucie. \"Judge you! Is it likely that  trouble of\\none wife and mother would be much to us now?\"\\n  She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed.\\nDefarge went last, and closed  door.\\n  \"Courage, my dear Lucie,\" said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her.\\n\"Courage, courage! So far all goes well with us- much, much better\\nthan it has of late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a\\nthankful heart.\"\\n  \"I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to\\nthrow a shadow on me and on all my hopes.\"\\n  \"Tut, tut!\" said Mr. Lorry; \"what is this despondency in  brave\\nlittle breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.\"\\n  But  shadow of  manner of these Defarges was dark upon\\nhimself, for an that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.\\n  IV\\n  CALM IN STORM\\n\\n  DOCTOR MANETTE did not return until  morning of  fourth day of\\nhis absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as\\ncould be kept from  knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from\\nher, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far\\napart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of\\nboth sexes and all ages had been killed by  populace; that four\\ndays and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that \\nair around her had been tainted by  slain. She only knew that there\\nhad been an attack upon  prisons, that all political prisoners\\nhad been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by  crowd\\nand murdered.\\n  To Mr. Lorry,  Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy\\non which he had no need to dwell, that  crowd had taken him through\\na scene of carnage to  prison of La Force. That, in  prison he\\nhad found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which \\nprisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly\\nordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a\\nfew cases) to be sent back to their cells. That, presented by his\\nconductors to this Tribunal, he had announced himself by name and\\nprofession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused\\nprisoner in  Bastille; that, one of  body so sitting in judgment\\nhad risen and identified him, and that this man was Defarge.\\n  That, hereupon he had ascertained, through  registers on \\ntable, that his son-in-law was among  living prisoners, and had\\npleaded hard to  Tribunal- of whom some members were asleep and\\nsome awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some\\nnot- for his life and liberty. That, in  first frantic greetings\\nlavished on himself as a notable sufferer under  overthrown system,\\nit had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before\\n lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on  point of being\\nat once released, when  tide in his favour met with some\\nunexplained check (not intelligible to  Doctor), which led to a few\\nwords of secret conference. That,  man sitting as President had\\nthen informed Doctor Manette that  prisoner must remain in custody,\\nbut should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That,\\nimmediately, on a signal,  prisoner was removed to  interior\\nof  prison again; but, that he,  Doctor, had then so strongly\\npleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his\\nson-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to \\nconcourse whose murderous yells outside  gate had often drowned \\nproceedings, that he had obtained  permission, and had remained\\nin that Hall of Blood until  danger was over.\\n  The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and\\nsleep by intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over \\nprisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than  mad\\nferocity against those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was,\\nhe said, who had been discharged into  street free, but at whom a\\nmistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought\\nto go to him and dress  wound,  Doctor had passed out at \\nsame gate, and had found him in  arms of a company of Samaritans,\\nwho were seated on  bodies of their victims. With an\\ninconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they\\nhad helped  healer, and tended  wounded man with  gentlest\\nsolicitude- had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully\\nfrom  spot- had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew\\ninto a butchery so dreadful, that  Doctor had covered his eyes with\\nhis hands, and swooned away in  midst of it.\\n  As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched \\nface of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose\\nwithin him that such dread experiences would revive  old danger.\\nBut, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had\\nnever at all known him in his present character. For  first time\\n Doctor felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For\\n first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged\\n iron which could break  prison door of his daughter\\'s\\nhusband, and deliver him. \"It all tended to a good end, my friend;\\nit was not mere waste and ruin. As my beloved child was helpful in\\nrestoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring  dearest\\npart of herself to her; by  aid of Heaven I will do it!\" Thus,\\nDoctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw  kindled eyes, \\nresolute face,  calm strong look and bearing of  man whose\\nlife always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so\\nmany years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain\\ndormant during  cessation of its usefulness, he believed.\\n  Greater things than  Doctor had at that time to contend with,\\nwould have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept\\nhimself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all\\ndegrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he\\nused his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon  inspecting\\nphysician of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now\\nassure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was\\nmixed with  general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly,\\nand brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes\\nher husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by  Doctor\\'s\\nhand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among \\nmany wild suspicions of plots in  prisons,  wildest of all\\npointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or\\npermanent connections abroad.\\n  This new life of  Doctor\\'s was an anxious life, no doubt;\\nstill,  sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining\\npride in it. Nothing unbecoming tinged  pride; it was a natural and\\nworthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that\\nup to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in  minds\\nof his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction,\\ndeprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew\\nhimself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which\\nthey both looked for Charles\\'s ultimate safety and deliverance, he\\nbecame so far exalted by  change, that he took  lead and\\ndirection, and required them as  weak, to trust to him as \\nstrong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were\\nreversed, yet only as  liveliest gratitude and affection could\\nreverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some\\nservice to her who had rendered so much to him. \"All curious to\\nsee,\" thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, \"but all natural\\nand right; so, take  lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn\\'t\\nbe in better hands.\"\\n  But, though  Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get\\nCharles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to\\ntrial,  public current of  time set too strong and fast for him.\\nThe new era began;  king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; \\nRepublic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for\\nvictory or death against  world in arms;  black flag waved night\\nand day from  great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand\\nmen, summoned to rise against  tyrants of  earth, rose from\\nall  varying soils of France, as if  dragon\\'s teeth had been\\nsown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on\\nrock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under  bright sky of  South\\nand under  clouds of  North, in fell and forest, in \\nvineyards and  olive-grounds and among  cropped grass and \\nstubble of  corn, along  fruitful banks of  broad rivers, and\\nin  sand of  sea-shore. What private solicitude could rear\\nitself against  deluge of  Year One of Liberty-  deluge\\nrising from below, not falling from above, and with  windows of\\nHeaven shut, not opened!\\n  There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting\\nrest, no measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as\\nregularly as when time was young, and  evening and morning were \\nfirst day, other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost\\nin  raging fever of a nation, as it is in  fever of one patient.\\nNow, breaking  unnatural silence of a whole city,  executioner\\nshowed  people  head of  king- and now, it seemed almost in\\n same breath,  bead of his fair wife which had had eight weary\\nmonths of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.\\n  And yet, observing  strange law of contradiction which obtains in\\nall such cases,  time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A\\nrevolutionary tribunal in  capital, and forty or fifty thousand\\nrevolutionary committees all over  land; a law of  Suspected,\\nwhich struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over\\nany good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged\\nwith people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no bearing;\\nthese things became  established order and nature of appointed\\nthings, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks\\nold. Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had\\nbeen before  general gaze from  foundations of  world- \\nfigure of  sharp female called La Guillotine.\\n  It was  popular theme for jests; it was  best cure for\\nheadache, it ifallibly prevented  hair from turning grey, it\\nimparted a peculiar delicacy to  complexion, it was  National\\nRazor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through \\nlittle window and sneezed into  sack. It was  sign of \\nregeneration of  human race. It superseded  Cross. Models of\\nit were worn on breasts from which  Cross was discarded, and it was\\nbowed down to and believed in where  Cross was denied.\\n  It sheared off heads so many, that it, and  ground it most\\npolluted, were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle\\nfor a young Devil, and was put together again when  occasion wanted\\nit. It hushed  eloquent, struck down  powerful, abolished \\nbeautiful and good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one\\nliving and one dead, it had lopped  heads off, in one morning, in\\nas many minutes. The name of  strong man of Old Scripture had\\ndescended to  chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he\\nwas stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away  gates\\nof God\\'s own Temple every day.\\n  Among these terrors, and  brood belonging to them,  Doctor\\nwalked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously\\npersistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie\\'s\\nhusband at last. Yet  current of  time swept by, so strong and\\ndeep, and carried  time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain\\nin prison one year and three months when  Doctor was thus steady\\nand confident. So much more wicked and distracted had  Revolution\\ngrown in that December month, that  rivers of  South were\\nencumbered with  bodies of  violently drowned by night, and\\nprisoners were shot in lines and squares under  southern wintry\\nsun. Still,  Doctor walked among  terrors with a steady head. No\\nman better known than he, in Paris at that day; no man in a stranger\\nsituation. Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using\\nhis art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart. In\\n exercise of his skill,  appearance and  story of \\nBastille Captive removed him from all other men. He was not\\nsuspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed\\nbeen recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit\\nmoving among mortals.\\n  V\\n  THE WOOD-SAWYER\\n\\n  ONE YEAR and three months. During all that time Lucie was never\\nsure, from hour to hour, but that  Guillotine would strike off\\nher husband\\'s head next day. Every day, through  stony streets, \\ntumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls;\\nbright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart\\nmen and old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La\\nGuillotine, all daily brought into light from  dark cellars of\\n loathsome prisons, and carried to her through  streets to slake\\nher devouring thirst. Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;- \\nlast, much  easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!\\n  If  suddenness of her calamity, and  whirling wheels of \\ntime, had stunned  Doctor\\'s daughter into awaiting  result in\\nidle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many.\\nBut, from  hour when she had taken  white head to her fresh\\nyoung bosom in  garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her\\nduties. She was truest to them in  season of trial, as all \\nquietly loyal and good will always be.\\n  As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her\\nfather had entered on  routine of his avocations, she arranged\\n little household as exactly as if her husband had been there.\\nEverything had its appointed place and its appointed time. Little\\nLucie she taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in\\ntheir English home. The slight devices with which she cheated\\nherself into  show of a belief that they would soon be reunited-\\n little preparations for his speedy return,  setting aside of\\nhis chair and his books- these, and  solemn prayer at night for one\\ndear prisoner especially, among  many unhappy souls in prison and\\n shadow of death- were almost  only outspoken reliefs of her\\nheavy mind.\\n  She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses,\\nakin to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat\\nand as well attended to as  brighter clothes of happy days. She\\nlost her colour, and  old and intent expression was a constant, not\\nan occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and\\ncomely. Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst\\ninto  grief she had repressed all day, and would say that her\\nsole reliance, under Heaven, was on him. He always resolutely\\nanswered: \"Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I\\nknow that I can save him, Lucie.\"\\n  They had not made  round of their changed life many weeks, when\\nher father said to her, on coming home one evening:\\n  \"My dear, there is an upper window in  prison, to which Charles\\ncan sometimes gain access at three in  afternoon. When he can get\\nto it- which depends on many uncertainties and incidents- he might see\\nyou in  street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I\\ncan show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child,\\nand even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of\\nrecognition.\"\\n  \"O show me  place, my father, and I will go there every day.\"\\n  From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As\\n clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly\\naway. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with\\nher, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she\\nnever missed a single day.\\n  It was  dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The\\nhovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was  only house\\nat that end; all else was wall. On  third day of her being there,\\nhe noticed her.\\n  \"Good day, citizeness.\"\\n  \"Good day, citizen.\"\\n  This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been\\nestablished voluntarily some time ago, among  more thorough\\npatriots; but, was now law for everybody.\\n  \"Walking here again, citizeness?\"\\n  \"You see me, citizen!\"\\n  The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture\\n(he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at  prison,\\npointed at  prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face\\nto represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.\\n  \"But it\\'s not my business,\" said he. And went on sawing his wood.\\n  Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her  moment she\\nappeared.\\n  \"What? Walking here again, citizeness?\"\\n  \"Yes, citizen.\"\\n  \"Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?\"\\n  \"Do I say yes, mamma?\" whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.\\n  \"Yes, dearest.\"\\n  \"Yes, citizen.\"\\n  \"Ah! But it\\'s not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I\\ncall it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head\\ncomes!\" The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.\\n  \"I call myself  Samson of  firewood guillotine. See here\\nagain! Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off her head comes! Now, a\\nchild. Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off its head comes. All \\nfamily!\"\\n  Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it\\nwas impossible to be there while  wood-sawyer was at work, and\\nnot be in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she\\nalways spoke to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he\\nreadily received.\\n  He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite\\nforgotten him in gazing at  prison roof and grates, and in\\nlifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find\\nhim looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped\\nin its work. \"But it\\'s not my business!\" he would generally say at\\nthose times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.\\n  In all weathers, in  snow and frost of winter, in  bitter\\nwinds of spring, in  bot sunshine of summer, in  rains of\\nautumn, and again in  snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two\\nhours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she\\nkissed  prison wall. Her husband saw her (so she learned from her\\nfather) it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or\\nthrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together.\\nIt was enough that he could and did see her when  chances served,\\nand on that possibility she would have waited out  day, seven\\ndays a week.\\n  These occupations brought her round to  December month, wherein\\nher father walked among  terrors with a steady head. On a\\nlightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at  usual corner. It was a\\nday of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen  houses,\\nas she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red\\ncaps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with \\nstandard inscription (tricoloured letters were  favourite),\\nRepublic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!\\n  The miserable shop of  wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole\\nsurface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got\\nsomebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in\\nwith most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed\\npike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed\\nhis saw inscribed as his \"Little Sainte Guillotine\"- for  great\\nsharp female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut\\nand he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her\\nquite alone.\\n  But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement\\nand a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment\\nafterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round  corner by\\n prison wall, in  midst of whom was  wood-sawyer hand in hand\\nwith The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people,\\nand they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other\\nmusic than their own singing. They danced to  popular Revolution\\nsong, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in\\nunison. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men\\ndanced together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they\\nwere a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but,\\nas they filled  place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some\\nghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them.\\nThey advanced, retreated, struck at one another\\'s hands, clutched at\\none another\\'s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun\\nround in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, \\nrest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then  ring\\nbroke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned\\nuntil they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and\\ntore, and then reversed  spin, and all spun round another way.\\nSuddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out  time afresh,\\nformed into lines  width of  public way, and, with their heads\\nlow down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. No fight\\ncould have been half so terrible as this dance. It was so emphatically\\na fallen sport- a something, once innocent, delivered over to all\\ndevilry- a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering  blood,\\nbewildering  senses, and steeling  heart. Such grace as was\\nvisible in it, made it  uglier, showing how warped and perverted\\nall things good by nature were become. The maidenly bosom bared to\\nthis,  pretty almost-child\\'s head thus distracted,  delicate\\nfoot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of \\ndisjointed time.\\n  This was  Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened\\nand bewildered in  doorway of  wood-sawyer\\'s house,  feathery\\nsnow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never\\nbeen.\\n  \"O my father!\" for he stood before her when she lifted up  eyes\\nshe had momentarily darkened with her hand; \"such a cruel, bad sight.\"\\n  \"I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don\\'t be\\nfrightened! Not one of them would harm you.\"\\n  \"I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my\\nhusband, and  mercies of these people--\"\\n  \"We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him\\nclimbing to  window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here\\nto see. You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.\"\\n  \"I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!\"\\n  \"You cannot see him, my poor dear?\"\\n  \"No, father,\" said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her\\nhand, \"no.\"\\n  A footstep in  snow. Madame Defarge. \"I salute you,\\ncitizeness,\" from  Doctor. \"I salute you, citizen.\" This in\\npassing. Nothing more. Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over \\nwhite road.\\n  \"Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of\\ncheerfulness and courage, for his sake. That was well done;\" they\\nhad left  spot; \"it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for\\nto-morrow.\"\\n  \"For to-morrow!\"\\n  \"There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are\\nprecautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually\\nsummoned before  Tribunal. He has not received  notice yet,\\nbut I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and\\nremoved to  Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not\\nafraid?\"\\n  She could scarcely answer, \"I trust in you.\"\\n  \"Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he\\nshall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him\\nwith every protection. I must see Lorry.\"\\n  He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing.\\nThey both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils\\nfaring away with their dread loads over  hushing snow.\\n  \"I must see Lorry,\"  Doctor repeated, turning her another way.\\n  The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it.\\nHe and his books were in frequent requisition as to property\\nconfiscated and made national. What he could save for  owners, he\\nsaved. No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson\\'s had in\\nkeeping, and to hold his peace.\\n  A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from  Seine,\\ndenoted  approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived\\nat  Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether\\nblighted and deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in  court,\\nran  letters: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible.\\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!\\n  Who could that be with Mr. Lorry-  owner of  riding-coat\\nupon  chair- who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did\\nhe come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his\\narms? To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when,\\nraising his voice and turning his head towards  door of  room\\nfrom which he had issued, he said: \"Removed to  Conciergerie, and\\nsummoned for to-morrow?\"\\n  VI\\n  TRIUMPH\\n\\n  THE DREAD TRIBUNAL of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined\\nJury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were\\nread out by  gaolers of  various prisons to their prisoners. The\\nstandard gaoler-joke was, \"Come out and listen to  Evening Paper,\\nyou inside there!\"\\n  \"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!\"\\n  So at last began  Evening Paper at La Force.\\n  When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved\\nfor those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles\\nEvremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know  usage; he had seen\\nhundreds pass away so.\\n  His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over\\nthem to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through\\n list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were\\ntwenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of\\n prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two\\nhad already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in\\n vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen  associated prisoners\\non  night of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in \\nmassacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with,\\nhad died on  scaffold.\\n  There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but  parting\\nwas soon over. It was  incident of every day, and  society of La\\nForce were engaged in  preparation of some games of forfeits and\\na little concert, for that evening. They crowded to  grates and\\nshed tears there; but, twenty places in  projected entertainments\\nhad to be refilled, and  time was, at best, short to  lock-up\\nhour, when  common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to\\n great dogs who kept watch there through  night. The prisoners\\nwere far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of \\ncondition of  time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a\\nspecies of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have\\nled some persons to brave  guillotine unnecessarily, and to die\\nby it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of  wildly\\nshaken public mind. In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a\\nsecret attraction to  disease-a terrible passing inclination to die\\nof it. And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only\\nneeding circumstances to evoke them.\\n  The passage to  Conciergerie was short and dark;  night in its\\nvermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners\\nwere put to  bar before Charles Darnay\\'s name was called. All \\nfifteen were condemned, and  trials of  whole occupied an hour\\nand a half.\\n  \"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,\" was at length arraigned.\\n  His judges sat upon  Bench in feathered hats; but  rough red\\ncap and tricoloured cockade was  head-dress otherwise prevailing.\\nLooking at  Jury and  turbulent audience, he might have\\nthought that  usual order of things was reversed, and that \\nfelons were trying  honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst\\npopulace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad,\\nwere  directing spirits of  scene: noisily commenting,\\napplauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating \\nresult, without a check. Of  men,  greater part were armed in\\nvarious ways; of  women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate\\nand drank as they looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was\\none, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. She\\nwas in a front row, by  side of a man whom he had never seen\\nsince his arrival at  Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as\\nDefarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and\\nthat she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in  two\\nfigures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as\\nthey could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be\\nwaiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked\\nat  Jury, but at nothing else. Under  President sat Doctor\\nManette, in his usual quiet dress. As well as  prisoner could\\nsee, he and Mr. Lorry were  only men there, unconnected with \\nTribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed  coarse\\ngarb of  Carmagnole.\\n  Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by  public\\nprosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to  Republic,\\nunder  decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was\\nnothing that  decree bore date since his return to France. There he\\nwas, and there was  decree; he had been taken in France, and his\\nhead was demanded.\\n  \"Take off his head!\" cried  audience. \"An enemy to  Republic!\"\\n  The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked \\nprisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in\\nEngland?\\n  Undoubtedly it was.\\n  Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?\\n  Not an emigrant, he hoped, within  sense and spirit of  law.\\n  Why not?  President desired to know.\\n  Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful\\nto him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his\\ncountry- he submitted before  word emigrant in  present\\nacceptation by  Tribunal was in use- to live by his own industry in\\nEngland, rather than on  industry of  overladen people of\\nFrance.\\n  What proof had he of this?\\n  He handed in  names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and\\nAlexandre Manette.\\n  But he had married in England?  President reminded him.\\n  True, but not an English woman.\\n  A citizeness of France?\\n  Yes. By birth.\\n  Her name and family\", \"Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor\\nManette,  good physician who sits there.\"\\n  This answer had a happy effect upon  audience. Cries in\\nexaltation of  well-known good physician rent  hall. So\\ncapriciously were  people moved, that tears immediately rolled down\\nseveral ferocious countenances which had been glaring at \\nprisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out\\ninto  streets and kill him.\\n  On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set\\nhis foot according to Doctor Manette\\'s reiterated instructions. The\\nsame cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had\\nprepared every inch of his road.\\n  The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did,\\nand not sooner?\\n  He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no\\nmeans of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in\\nEngland, he lived by giving instruction in  French language and\\nliterature. He had returned when he did, on  pressing and written\\nentreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his life was\\nendangered by his absence. He had come back, to save a citizen\\'s life,\\nand to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to \\ntruth. Was that criminal in  eyes of  Republic?\\n  The populace cried enthusiastically, \"No!\" and  President rang\\nhis bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry\\n\"No!\" untill they left off, of their own will.\\n  The President required  name of that citizen. The accused\\nexplained that  citizen was his first witness. He also referred\\nwith confidence to  citizen\\'s letter, which had been taken from him\\nat  Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among \\npapers then before  President.\\n  The Doctor had taken care that it should be there- had assured him\\nthat it would be there- and at this stage of  proceedings it was\\nproduced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did\\nso. Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness,\\nthat in  pressure of business imposed on  Tribunal by \\nmultitude of enemies of  Republic with which it had to deal, he had\\nbeen slightly overlooked in his prison of  Abbaye- in fact, had\\nrather passed out of  Tribunal\\'s patriotic remembrance- until three\\ndays ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at\\nliberty on  Jury\\'s declaring themselves satisfied that \\naccusation against him was answered, as to himself, by  surrender\\nof  citizen Evremonde, called Darnay.\\n  Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,\\nand  cleanness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as\\nhe proceeded, as he showed that  Accused was his first friend on\\nhis release from his long imprisonment; that,  accused had remained\\nin England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in\\ntheir exile; that, so far from being in favour with  Aristocrat\\ngovernment there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as\\n foe of England and friend of  United States- as he brought\\nthese circumstances into view, with  greatest discretion and with\\n straightforward force of truth and earnestness,  Jury and \\npopulace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur\\nLorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,\\nhad been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his\\naccount of it,  Jury declared that they had heard enough, and\\nthat they were ready with their votes if  President were content to\\nreceive them.\\n  At every vote ( Jurymen voted aloud and individually), \\npopulace set up a shout of applause. All  voices were in \\nprisoner\\'s favour, and  President declared him free.\\n  Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which \\npopulace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better\\nimpulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as\\nsome set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can\\ndecide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were\\nreferable; it is probable, to a blending of all  three, with \\nsecond predominating. No sooner was  acquittal pronounced, than\\ntears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal\\nembraces were bestowed upon  prisoner by as many of both sexes as\\ncould rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement\\nhe was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none  less because he\\nknew very well, that  very same people, carried by another current,\\nwould have rushed at him with  very same intensity, to rend him\\nto pieces and strew him over  streets.\\n  His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be\\ntried, rescued him from these caresses for  moment. Five were to be\\ntried together, next, as enemies of  Republic, forasmuch as they\\nhad not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was  Tribunal to\\ncompensate itself and  nation for a chance lost, that these five\\ncame down to him before he left  place, condemned to die within\\ntwenty-four hours. The first of them told him so, with  customary\\nprison sign of Death- a raised finger- and they all added in words,\\n\"Long live  Republic!\"\\n  The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their\\nproceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from  gate,\\nthere was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every\\nface he had seen in Court- except two, for which he looked in vain. On\\nhis coming out,  concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing,\\nand shouting, all by turns and all together, until  very tide of\\n river on  bank of which  mad scene was acted, seemed to\\nrun mad, like  people on  shore.\\n  They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which\\nthey had taken either out of  Court itself, or one of its rooms\\nor passages. Over  chair they had thrown a red flag, and to \\nback of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this\\ncar of triumph, not even  Doctor\\'s entreaties could prevent his\\nbeing carried to his home on men\\'s shoulders, with a confused sea of\\nred caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from  stormy\\ndeep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his\\nmind being in confusion, and that he was in  tumbril on his way\\nto  Guillotine\\n  In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing\\nhim out, they carried him on. Reddening  snowy streets with \\nprevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as\\nthey had reddened them below  snow with a deeper dye, they\\ncarried him thus into  courtyard of  building where he lived.\\nHer father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband\\nstood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.\\n  As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between\\nhis face and  brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips\\nmight come together unseen, a few of  people fell to dancing.\\nInstantly, all  rest fell to dancing, and  courtyard\\noverflowed with  Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into  vacant\\nchair a young woman from  crowd to be carried as  Goddess of\\nLiberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into  adjacent\\nstreets, and along  river\\'s bank, and over  bridge, \\nCarmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.\\n  After grasping  Doctor\\'s hand, as he stood victorious and proud\\nbefore him; after grasping  hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting\\nin breathless from his struggle against  waterspout of \\nCarmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her\\narms round his neck; and after embracing  ever zealous and faithful\\nPross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up\\nto their rooms.\\n  \"Lucie! My own! I am safe.\"\\n  \"O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I\\nhave prayed to Him.\"\\n  They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again\\nin his arms, he said to her:\\n  \"And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this\\nFrance could have done what he has done for me.\"\\n  She laid her head upon her father\\'s breast, as she had laid his poor\\nhead on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in  return\\nhe had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of\\nhis strength. \"You must not be weak, my darling,\" he remonstrated;\\n\"don\\'t tremble so. I have saved him.\"\\n  VII\\n  A KNOCK AT THE DOOR\\n\\n  \"I HAVE SAVED HIM.\" It was not another of  dreams in which he had\\noften come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and\\na vague but heavy fear was upon her.\\n  All  air round was so thick and dark,  people were so\\npassionately revengeful and fitful,  innocent were so constantly\\nput to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible\\nto forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to\\nothers as he was to her, every day shared  fate from which he had\\nbeen clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as\\nshe felt it ought to be. The shadows of  wintry afternoon were\\nbeginning to fall, and even now  dreadful carts were rolling\\nthrough  streets. Her mind pursued them, looking for him among\\n Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and\\ntrembled more.\\n  Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this\\nwoman\\'s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no\\nshoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had\\naccomplished  task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he\\nhad saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him.\\n  Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because\\nthat was  safest way of life, involving  least offence to \\npeople, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his\\nimprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his\\nguard, and towards  living of  poorer prisoners. Partly on\\nthis account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no\\nservant;  citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at \\ncourtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost\\nwholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had become their daily\\nretainer, and had his bed there every night.\\n  It was an ordinance of  Republic One and Indivisible of\\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on  door or\\ndoorpost of every house,  name of every inmate must be legibly\\ninscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height\\nfrom  ground. Mr. Jerry Cruncher\\'s name, therefore, duly\\nembellished  doorpost down below; and, as  afternoon shadows\\ndeepened,  owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking\\na painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to  list  name\\nof Charles Evremonde, called Darnay.\\n  In  universal fear and distrust that darkened  time, all \\nusual harmless ways of life were changed. In  Doctor\\'s little\\nhousehold, as in very many others,  articles of daily consumption\\nthat were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and\\nat various small shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as\\nlittle occasion as possible for talk and envy, was  general desire.\\n  For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged \\noffice of purveyors;  former carrying  money;  latter, \\nbasket. Every afternoon at about  time when  public lamps were\\nlighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such\\npurchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long\\nassociation with a French family, might have known as much of their\\nlanguage as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that\\ndirection; consequently she knew no more of that \"nonsense\" (as she\\nwas pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of\\nmarketing was to plump a noun-substantive at  head of a\\nshopkeeper without any introduction in  nature of an article,\\nand, if it happened not to be  name of  thing she wanted, to\\nlook round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until \\nbargain was concluded. She always made a bargain for it, by holding\\nup, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than \\nmerchant beld up, whatever his number might be.\\n  \"Now, Mr. Cruncher,\" said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with\\nfelicity; \"if you are ready, I am.\"\\n  Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross\\'s service. He had\\nworn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky\\nhead down.\\n  \"There\\'s all manner of things wanted,\" said Miss Pross, \"and we\\nshall have a precious time of it. We want wine, among  rest. Nice\\ntoasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.\"\\n  \"It will be much  same to your knowledge, miss, I should\\nthink,\" retorted Jerry, \"whether they drink your health or  Old\\nUn\\'s.\"\\n  \"Who\\'s he?\" said Miss Pross.\\n  Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning\\n\"Old Nick\\'s.\"\\n  \"Ha!\" said Miss Pross, \"it doesn\\'t need an interpreter to explain\\n meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it\\'s Midnight\\nMurder, and Mischief.\"\\n  \"Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!\" cried Lucie.\\n  \"Yes, yes, yes, I\\'ll be cautious,\" said Miss Pross; \"but I may say\\namong ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and\\ntobaccoey smotherings in  form of embracings all round, going on in\\n streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I\\ncome back! Take care of  dear husband you have recovered, and don\\'t\\nmove your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you\\nsee me again! May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?\"\\n  \"I think you may take that liberty,\"  Doctor answered, smiling.\\n  \"For gracious sake, don\\'t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough\\nof that,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  \"Hush, dear! Again?\" Lucie remonstrated.\\n  \"Well, my sweet,\" said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically,\\n\" short and  long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most\\nGracious Majesty King George  Third;\" Miss Pross curtseyed at \\nname; and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate\\ntheir knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save  King!\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated  words\\nafter Miss Pross, like somebody at church.\\n  \"I am glad you have so much of  Englishman in you, though I\\nwish you had never taken that cold in your voice,\" said Miss Pross,\\napprovingly. \"But  question, Doctor Manette. Is there\"- it was\\n good creature\\'s way to affect to make light of anything that was a\\ngreat anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance\\nmanner- \"is there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?\"\\n  \"I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.\"\\n  \"Heigh-ho-hum!\" said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she\\nglanced at her darling\\'s golden hair in  light of  fire, \"then\\nwe must have patience and wait: that\\'s all. We must hold up our\\nheads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr.\\nCruncher!-Don\\'t you move, Ladybird!\"\\n  They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and \\nchild, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from\\n Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted  lamp, but had put it\\naside in a corner, that they might enjoy  fire-light undisturbed.\\nLittle Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his\\narm: and he, in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to\\ntell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a\\nprison-wall and let out a captive who had once done  Fairy a\\nservice. All was subdued and quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than\\nshe had been.\\n  \"What is that?\" she cried, all at once.\\n  \"My dear!\" said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his\\nhand on hers, \"command yourself. What a disordered state you are in!\\nThe least thing- nothing- startles you! You, your father\\'s daughter!\"\\n  \"I thought, my father,\" said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale\\nface and in a faltering voice, \"that I heard strange feet upon \\nstairs.\"\\n  \"My love,  staircase is as still as Death.\"\\n  As he said  word, a blow was struck upon  door.\\n  \"Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!\"\\n  \"My child,\" said  Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her\\nshoulder, \"I have saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go\\nto  door.\"\\n  He took  lamp in his hand, crossed  two intervening outer\\nrooms, and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over  floor, and\\nfour rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered \\nroom.\\n  \"The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,\" said  first.\\n  \"Who seeks him?\" answered Darnay.\\n  \"I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before\\n Tribunal to-day. You are again  prisoner of  Republic.\"\\n  The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child\\nclinging to him.\\n  \"Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?\"\\n  \"It is enough that you return straight to  Conciergerie, and will\\nknow to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.\"\\n  Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone,\\nthat he stood with  lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made\\nto bold it. moved after these words were spoken, put  lamp down,\\nand confronting  speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by \\nloose front of his red woollen shirt, said:\\n  \"You know him, you have said. Do you know me?\"\\n  \"Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.\"\\n  \"We all know you, Citizen Doctor,\" said  other three.\\n  He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower\\nvoice, after a pause:\\n  \"Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?\"\\n  \"Citizen Doctor,\" said  first, reluctantly, \"he has been\\ndenounced to  Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,\" pointing out\\n second who had entered, \\'is from Saint Antoine.\"\\n  The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:\\n  \"He is accused by Saint Antoine.\"\\n  \"Of what?\" asked  Doctor.\\n  \"Citizen Doctor,\" said  first, with his former reluctance, \"ask\\nno more. If  Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt\\nyou as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes\\nbefore all. The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.\"\\n  \"One word,\"  Doctor entreated. \"Will you tell me who denounced\\nhim?\"\\n  \"It is against rule,\" answered  first; \"but you can ask Him of\\nSaint Antoine here.\"\\n  The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on\\nhis feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:\\n  \"Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced- and gravely-\\nby  Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.\"\\n  \"What other?\"\\n  \"Do you ask, Citizen Doctor?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"Then,\" said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, \"you will\\nbe answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!\"\\n  VIII\\n  A HAND AT CARDS\\n\\n  HAPPILY UNCONSCIOUS of  new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded\\nher way along  narrow streets and crossed  river by  bridge\\nof  Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind  number of indispensable\\npurchases she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with  basket, walked at\\nher side. They both looked to  right and to  left into most of\\n shops they passed, had a wary eye for an gregarious assemblages of\\npeople, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group\\nof talkers. It was a raw evening, and  misty river, blurred to\\n eye with blazing lights and to  ear with harsh noises, showed\\nwhere  barges were stationed in which  smiths worked, making\\nguns for  Army of  Republic. Woe to  man who played tricks\\nwith that Army, or got undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that\\nhis beard had never grown, for  National Razor shaved him close.\\n  Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of\\noil for  lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of  wine they\\nwanted. After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at  sign\\nof  Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from \\nNational Palace, once (and twice)  Tuileries, where  aspect of\\nthings rather took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other\\nplace of  same description they had passed, and, though red with\\npatriotic caps, was not so red as  rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and\\nfinding him of her opinion, Miss Pross resorted to  Good Republican\\nBrutus of Antiquity, attended by her cavalier.\\n  Slightly observant of  smoky lights; of  people, pipe in\\nmouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of  one\\nbare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal\\naloud, and of  others listening to him; of  weapons worn, or\\nlaid aside to be resumed; of  two or three customers fallen forward\\nasleep, who in  popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer\\nlooked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs;  two\\noutlandish customers approached  counter, and showed what they\\nwanted.\\n  As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in\\na corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross.\\nNo sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and\\nclapped her hands.\\n  In a moment,  whole company were on their feet. That somebody was\\nassassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was \\nlikeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but\\nonly saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other;  man\\nwith all  outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough\\nRepublican;  woman, evidently English.\\n  What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by  disciples of\\n Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was\\nsomething very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew\\nor Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been\\nall ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For,\\nit must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement\\nand agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher- though it seemed on his own separate\\nand individual account- was in a state of  greatest wonder.\\n  \"What is  matter?\" said  man who had caused Miss Pross to\\nscream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone),\\nand in English.\\n  \"Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!\" cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands\\nagain. \"After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so\\nlong a time, do I find you here!\"\\n  \"Don\\'t call me Solomon. Do you want to be  death of me?\" asked\\n man, in a furtive, frightened way.\\n  \"Brother, brother!\" cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. \"Have I\\never been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?\"\\n  \"Then hold your meddlesome tongue,\" said Solomon, \"and come out,\\nif you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who\\'s\\nthis man?\"\\n  Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no\\nmeans affectionate brother, said through her tears, \"Mr. Cruncher.\"\\n  \"Let him come out too,\" said Solomon. \"Does he think me a ghost?\"\\n  Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a\\nword, however, and Miss Pross, exploring  depths of her reticule\\nthrough her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she\\ndid so, Solomon turned to  followers of  Good Republican\\nBrutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in \\nFrench language, which caused them all to relapse into their former\\nplaces and pursuits.\\n  \"Now,\" said Solomon, stopping at  dark street coriner, \"what do\\nyou want?\"\\n  \"How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my\\nlove away from!\" cried Miss Pross, \"to give me such a greeting, and\\nshow me no affection.\"\\n  \"There. Con-found it! There,\" said Solomon, making a dab at Miss\\nPross\\'s lips with his own. \"Now are you content?\"\\n  Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.\\n  \"If you expect me to be surprised,\" said her brother Solomon, \"I\\nam not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who\\nare here. If you really don\\'t want to endanger my existence- which I\\nhalf believe you do- go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go\\nmine. I am busy. I am an official.\"\\n  \"My English brother Solomon,\" mourned Miss Pross, casting up her\\ntear-fraught eyes, \"that had  makings in him of one of  best and\\ngreatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners,\\nand such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen  dear boy\\nlying in his--\"\\n  \"I said so!\" cried her brother, interrupting. \"I knew it. You want\\nto be  death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own\\nsister. Just as I am getting on!\"\\n  \"The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!\" cried Miss Pross. \"Far\\nrather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever\\nloved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to\\nme, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and\\nI will detain you no longer.\"\\n  Good Miss Pross! As if  estrangement between them had come of any\\nculpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact,\\nyears ago, in  quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had\\nspent her money and left her!\\n  He was saying  affectionate word, however, with a far more\\ngrudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their\\nrelative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably\\n case, all  world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on\\n shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with \\nfollowing singular question:\\n  \"I say! Might I ask  favour? As to whether your name is John\\nSolomon, or Solomon John?\"\\n  The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not\\npreviously uttered a word.\\n  \"Come!\" said Mr. Cruncher. \"Speak out, you know.\" (Which, by \\nway, was more than he could do himself.) \"John Solomon, or Solomon\\nJohn? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And\\nI know you\\'re John, you know. Which of  two goes first? And\\nregarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn\\'t your name over \\nwater.\"\\n  \"What do you mean?\"\\n  \"Well, I don\\'t know all I mean, for I can\\'t call to mind what your\\nname was, over  water.\"\\n  \"No?\"\\n  \"No. But I\\'ll swear it was a name of two syllables.\"\\n  \"Indeed?\"\\n  \"Yes. T\\'other one\\'s was one syllable. I know you. You was a\\nspy-witness at  Bailey. What, in  name of  Father of Lies,\\nown father to yourself, was you called at that time?\"\\n  \"Barsad,\" said another voice, striking in.\\n  \"That\\'s  name for a thousand pound!\" cried Jerry.\\n  The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands\\nbehind him under  skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr.\\nCruncher\\'s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at  Old\\nBailey itself.\\n  \"Don\\'t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry\\'s,\\nto his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present\\nmyself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I\\npresent myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish\\nyou had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your\\nsake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of  Prisons.\"\\n  Sheep was a cant word of  time for a spy, under  gaolers.\\nThe spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--\\n  \"I\\'ll tell you,\" said Sydney. \"I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad,\\ncoming out of  prison of  Conciergerie while I was contemplating\\n walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered,\\nand I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that\\nconnection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for\\nassociating you with  misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate,\\nI walked in your direction. I walked into  wine-shop here, close\\nafter you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your\\nunreserved conversation, and  rumour openly going about among\\nyour admirers,  nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had\\ndone at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\"\\n  \"What purpose?\"  spy asked.\\n  \"It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in\\n street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of\\nyour company- at  office of Tellson\\'s Bank, for instance?\"\\n  \"Under a threat?\"\\n  \"Oh! Did I say that?\"\\n  \"Then, why should I go there?\"\\n  \"Really, Mr. Barsad, I can\\'t say, if you can\\'t.\"\\n  \"Do you mean that you won\\'t say, sir?\"  spy irresolutely asked.\\n  \"You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won\\'t.\"\\n  Carton\\'s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid\\nof his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret\\nmind, and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye\\nsaw it, and made  most of it.\\n  \"Now, I told you so,\" said  spy, casting a reproachful look at\\nhis sister; \"if any trouble comes of this, it\\'s your doing.\"\\n  \"Come, come, Mr. Barsad!\" exclaimed Sydney. \"Don\\'t be ungrateful.\\nBut for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so\\npleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual\\nsatisfaction. Do you go with me to  Bank?\"\\n  \"I\\'ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I\\'ll go with you.\"\\n  \"I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to  corner of\\nher own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good\\ncity, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your\\nescort knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry\\'s with us. Are\\nwe ready? Come then!\"\\n  Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to  end of her life\\nremembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney\\'s arm and looked\\nup in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a\\nbraced purpose in  arm and a kind of inspiration in  eyes, which\\nnot only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised \\nman. She was too much occupied then with fears for  brother who\\nso little deserved her affection, and with Sydney\\'s friendly\\nreassurances, adequately to heed what she observed.\\n  They left her at  corner of  street, and Carton led  way to\\nMr. Lorry\\'s, which was within a few minutes\\' walk. John Barsad, or\\nSolomon Pross, walked at his side.\\n  Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a\\ncheery little log or two of fire- perhaps looking into their blaze for\\n picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson\\'s, who\\nhad looked into  red coals at  Royal George at Dover, now a good\\nmany years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed \\nsurprise with which he saw a stranger.\\n  \"Miss Pross\\'s brother, sir,\" said Sydney. \"Mr. Barsad.\"\\n  \"Barsad?\" repeated  old gentleman, \"Barsad? I have an association\\nwith  name- and with  face.\"\\n  \"I told you you a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,\" observed Carton,\\ncoolly. \"Pray sit down.\"\\n  As he took a chair himself, he supplied  link that Mr. Lorry\\nwanted, by saying to him with a frown, \"Witness at that trial.\" Mr.\\nLorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an\\nundisguised look of abhorrence.\\n  \"Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as  affectionate\\nbrother you have heard of,\" said Sydney, \"and has acknowledged \\nrelationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\"\\n  Struck with consternation,  old gentleman exclaimed, \"What do you\\ntell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about\\nto return to him!\"\\n  \"Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?\"\\n  \"Just now, if at all.\"\\n  \"Mr. Barsad is  best authority possible, sir,\" said Sydney,\\n\"and I have it from Mr. Barsad\\'s communication to a friend and brother\\nSheep over a bottle of wine, that  arrest has taken place. He\\nleft  messengers at  gate, and saw them admitted by \\nporter. There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry\\'s business eye read in  speaker\\'s face that it was loss\\nof time to dwell upon  point. Confused, but sensible that something\\nmight depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was\\nsilently attentive.\\n  \"Now, I trust,\" said Sydney to him, \"that  name and influence\\nof Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow-you said he\\nwould be before  Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--\"\\n   \"Yes; I believe so.\"\\n  \"-In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I\\nown to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette\\'s not having had\\n power to prevent this arrest.\"\\n  \"He may not have known of it beforehand,\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember\\nhow identified he is with his son-in-law.\"\\n  \"That\\'s true,\" Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his\\nchin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.\\n  \"In short,\" said Sydney, \"this is a desperate time, when desperate\\ngames are played for desperate stakes. Let  Doctor play  winning\\ngame; I will play  losing one. No man\\'s life here is worth\\npurchase. Any one carried home by  people to-day, may be\\ncondemned tomorrow. Now,  stake I have resolved to play for, in\\ncase of  worst, is a friend in  Conciergerie. And  friend I\\npurpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.\"\\n  \"You need have good cards, sir,\" said  spy.\\n  \"I\\'ll ran them over. I\\'ll see what I hold,- Mr. Lorry, you know what\\na brute I am; I wish you\\'d give me a little brandy.\"\\n  It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful-drank off another\\nglassful- pushed  bottle thoughtfully away.\\n  \"Mr. Barsad,\" he went on, in  tone of one who really was\\nlooking over a hand at cards: \"Sheep of  prisons, emissary of\\nRepublican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and\\nsecret informer, so much  more valuable here for being English that\\nan Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those\\ncharacters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under\\na false name. That\\'s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in  employ\\nof  republican French government, was formerly in  employ of \\naristocratic English government,  enemy of France and freedom.\\nThat\\'s an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of\\nsuspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in  pay of  aristocratic\\nEnglish government, is  spy of Pitt,  treacherous foe of \\nRepublic crouching in its bosom,  English traitor and agent of\\nall mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. That\\'s a card\\nnot to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?\"\\n  \"Not to understand your play,\" returned  spy, somewhat uneasily.\\n  \"I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to  nearest Section\\nCommittee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have.\\nDon\\'t hurry.\"\\n  He drew  bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy,\\nand drank it off. He saw that  spy was fearful of his drinking\\nhimself into a fit state for  immediate denunciation of him. Seeing\\nit, he poured out and drank another glassful.\\n  \"Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\"\\n  It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing\\ncards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his\\nhonourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard\\nswearing there- not because he was not wanted there; our English\\nreasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of\\nvery modern date- he knew that he had crossed  Channel, and\\naccepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper\\namong his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an\\neavesdropper among  natives. He knew that under  overthrown\\ngovernment he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge\\'s\\nwine-shop; had received from  watchful police such heads of\\ninformation concerning Doctor Manette\\'s imprisonment, release, and\\nhistory, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar\\nconversation with  Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge,\\nand had broken down with them signally. He always remembered with fear\\nand trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked\\nwith her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved. He had\\nsince seen her, in  Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again\\nproduce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives \\nguillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as\\nhe was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that\\nhe was tied fast under  shadow of  axe; and that in spite of his\\nutmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of  reigning\\nterror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on\\nsuch grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he\\nforesaw that  dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he\\nhad seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register,\\nand would quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men\\nare men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black\\nsuit, to justify  holder in growing rather livid as he turned\\nthem over.\\n  \"You scarcely seem to like your hand,\" said Sydney, with \\ngreatest composure. \"Do you play?\"\\n  \"I think, sir,\" said  spy, in  meanest manner, as he turned to\\nMr. Lorry, \"I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence,\\nto put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can\\nunder any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace\\nof which he has spoken. I admit that I am a spy, and that it is\\nconsidered a discreditable station- though it must be filled by\\nsomebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean\\nhimself as to make himself one?\"\\n  \"I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,\" said Carton, taking  answer on\\nhimself, and looking at his watch, \"without any scruple, in a very few\\nminutes.\"\\n  \"I should have hoped, gentlemen both,\" said  spy, always striving\\nto hook Mr. Lorry into  discussion, \"that your respect for my\\nsister--\"\\n  \"I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by\\nfinally relieving her of her brother,\" said Sydney Carton.\\n  \"You think not, sir?\"\\n  \"I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.\"\\n  The smooth manner of  spy, curiously in dissonance with his\\nostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,\\nreceived such a check from  inscrutability of Carton,- who was a\\nmystery to wiser and honester men than he,- that it faltered here\\nand failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his\\nformer air of contemplating cards:\\n  \"And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I\\nhave another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and\\nfellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in  country\\nprisons; who was he?\"\\n  \"French. You don\\'t know him,\" said  spy, quickly.\\n  \"French, eh?\" repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice\\nhim at all, though he echoed his word. \"Well; he may be.\"\\n  \"Is, I assure you,\" said  spy; \"though it\\'s not important.\"\\n  \"Though it\\'s not important,\" repeated Carton, in  same mechanical\\nway- \"though it\\'s not important- No, it\\'s not important. No. Yet I\\nknow  face.\"\\n  \"I think not. I am sure not. It can\\'t be,\" said  spy.\\n  \"It- can\\'t- be,\" muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and\\nfilling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. \"Can\\'t-\\nbe. Spoke good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?\"\\n  \"Provincial,\" said  spy.\\n  \"No. Foreign!\" cried Carton, striking his open hand on  table, as\\na light broke clearly on his mind. \"Cly! Disguised, but  same\\nman. We had that man before us at  Old Bailey.\"\\n  \"Now, there you are hasty, sir,\" said Barsad, with a smile that gave\\nhis aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; \"there you\\nreally give me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly\\nadmit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been\\ndead several years. I attended him in his last illness. He was\\nburied in London, at  church of Saint Pancras-in--Fields. His\\nunpopularity with  blackguard multitude at  moment prevented\\nmy following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.\"\\n  Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most\\nremarkable goblin shadow on  wall. Tracing it to its source, he\\ndiscovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and\\nstiffening of all  risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher\\'s head.\\n  \"Let us be reasonable,\" said  spy, \"and let us be fair. To show\\nyou how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I\\nwill lay before you a certificate of Cly\\'s burial, which I happened to\\nhave carried in my pocket-book,\" with a hurried hand he produced and\\nopened it, \"ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You\\nmay take it in your hand; it\\'s no forgery.\"\\n  Here, Mr. Lorry perceived  reflection on  wall to elongate,\\nand Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have\\nbeen more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by\\n Cow with  crumpled horn in  house that Jack built.\\n  Unseen by  spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him\\non  shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.\\n  \"That there Roger Cly, master,\" said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn\\nand iron-bound visage. \"So you put him in his coffin?\"\\n  \"I did.\"\\n  \"Who took him out of it?\"\\n  Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, \"What do you mean?\"\\n  \"I mean,\" said Mr. Cruncher, \"that he warn\\'t never in it. No! Not\\nhe! I\\'ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.\"\\n  The spy looked round at  two gentlemen; they both looked in\\nunspeakable astonishment at Jerry.\\n  \"I tell you,\" said Jerry, \"that you buried paving-stones and earth\\nin that there coffin. Don\\'t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was\\na take in. Me and two more knows it.\"\\n  \"How do you know it?\"\\n  \"What\\'s that to you? Ecod!\" growled Mr. Cruncher, \"it\\'s you I have\\ngot a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon\\ntradesmen! I\\'d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a\\nguinea.\"\\n  Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at\\nthis turn of  business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and\\nexplain himself.\\n  \"At another time, sir,\" he returned, evasively, \" present time is\\nillconwenient for explainin\\'. What I stand to, is, that he knows\\nwell wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he\\nwas, in so much as a word of one syllable, and I\\'ll either catch\\nhold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;\" Mr. Cruncher\\ndwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; \"or I\\'ll out and announce\\nhim.\"\\n  \"Humph! I see one thing,\" said Carton. \"I hold another card, Mr.\\nBarsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling \\nair, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication\\nwith another aristocratic spy of  same antecedents as yourself,\\nwho, moreover, has  mystery about him of having feigned death and\\ncome to life again! A plot in  prisons, of  foreigner against\\n Republic. A strong card- a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?\"\\n  \"No!\" returned  spy. \"I throw up. I confess that we were so\\nunpopular with  outrageous mob, that I only got away from England\\nat  risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted\\nup and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that\\nsham. Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of\\nwonders to me.\"\\n  \"Never you trouble your head about this man,\" retorted \\ncontentious Mr. Cruncher; \"you\\'ll have trouble enough with giving your\\nattention to that gentleman. And look here! Once more!\"- Mr.\\nCruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious\\nparade of his liberality- \"I\\'d catch hold of your throat and choke you\\nfor half a guinea.\"\\n  The Sheep of  prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,\\nwith more decision, \"It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and\\ncan\\'t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?\\nNow, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in\\nmy office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better\\ntrust my life to  chances of a refusal than  chances of consent.\\nIn short, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are\\nall desperate here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper,\\nand I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. Now,\\nwhat do you want with me?\"\\n  \"Not very much. You are a turnkey at  Conciergerie?\"\\n  \"I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape\\npossible,\" said  spy, firmly.\\n  \"Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at\\n Conciergerie?\"\\n  \"I am sometimes.\"\\n  \"You can be when you choose?\"\\n  \"I can pass in and out when I choose.\"\\n  Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out\\nupon  hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent,\\nhe said, rising:\\n  \"So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well\\nthat  merits of  cards should not rest solely between you and\\nme. Come into  dark room here, and let us have one final word\\nalone.\"\\n  IX\\n  THE GAME MADE\\n\\n  WHILE SYDNEY CARTON and  Sheep of  prisons were in \\nadjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr.\\nLorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That\\nhonest tradesman\\'s manner of receiving  look, did not inspire\\nconfidence; he changed  leg on which he rested, as often as if he\\nhad fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his\\nfinger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and\\nwhenever Mr. Lorry\\'s eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar\\nkind of short cough requiring  hollow of a hand before it, which is\\nseldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect\\nopenness of character.\\n  \"Jerry,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Come here.\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in\\nadvance of him.\\n  \"What have you been, besides a messenger?\"\\n  After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his\\npatron, Mr. Cruncher conceived  luminous idea of replying,\\n\"Agricultooral character.\"\\n  \"My mind misgives me much,\" said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a\\nforefinger at him, \"that you have used  respectable and great house\\nof Tellson\\'s as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful\\noccupation of an infamous description. If you have, don\\'t expect me to\\nbefriend you when you get back to England. If you have, don\\'t expect\\nme to keep your secret. Tellson\\'s shall not be imposed upon.\"\\n  \"I hope, sir,\" pleaded  abashed Mr. Cruncher, \"that a gentleman\\nlike yourself wot I\\'ve had  honour of odd jobbing till I\\'m grey\\nat it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so- I\\ndon\\'t say it is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into\\naccount that if it wos, it wouldn\\'t, even then, be all o\\' one side.\\nThere\\'d be two sides to it. There might be medical doctors at \\npresent hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman\\ndon\\'t pick up his fardens- fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens- half\\nfardens! no, nor yet his quarter- a banking away like smoke at\\nTellson\\'s, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on \\nsly, a going in and going out to their own carriages- ah! equally like\\nsmoke, if not more so. Well, that \\'ud be imposing, too, on\\nTellson\\'s. For you cannot sarse  goose and not  gander. And\\nhere\\'s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in  Old England times, and\\nwould be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin\\' again  business to\\nthat degree as is ruinating-stark ruinating! Whereas them medical\\ndoctors\\' wives don\\'t flop- catch \\'em at it! Or, if they flop, their\\nfloppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly\\nhave one without t\\'other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with\\nparish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen\\n(all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn\\'t get much by it, even if\\nit wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him,\\nMr. Lorry. He\\'d never have no good of it; he\\'d want all along to be\\nout of  line, if he could see his way but, being once in- even if\\nit wos so.\"\\n  \"Ugh!\" cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless. \"I am\\nshocked at  sight of you.\"\\n  \"Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,\" pursued Mr.\\nCruncher, \"even if it wos so, which I don\\'t say it is--\"\\n  \"Don\\'t prevaricate,\" said Mr. Lorry.\\n  \"No, I will not, sir,\" returned Mr. Cruncher, as if nothing were\\nfurther from his thoughts or practice- \"which I don\\'t say it is- wot I\\nwould humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there\\nstool, at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up\\nand growed up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you,\\ngeneral-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if\\nsuch should be your wishes. If it wos so, which I still don\\'t say it\\nis (for I will not prevaricate to you, sir), let that there boy keep\\nhis father\\'s place, and take care of his mother; don\\'t blow upon\\nthat boy\\'s father- do not do it, sir- and let that father go into\\n line of  reg\\'lar diggin\\', and make amends for what he would\\nhave undug- if it wos so- by diggin\\' of \\'em in with a will, and with\\nconwictions respectin\\'  futur\\' keepin\\' of \\'em safe. That, Mr.\\nLorry,\" said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an\\nannouncement that he had arrived at  peroration of his discourse,\\n\"is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don\\'t see all\\nthis here a goin\\' on dreadful round him, in  way of Subjects\\nwithout heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring  price down\\nto porterage and hardly that, without havin\\' his serious thoughts of\\nthings. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin\\' of\\nyou fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in \\ngood cause when I might have kep\\' it back.\"\\n  \"That at least is true,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Say no more now. It may be\\nthat I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in\\naction- not in words. I want no more words.\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and  spy\\nreturned from  dark room. \"Adieu, Mr. Barsad,\" said  former; our\\narrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.\"\\n  He sat down in a chair on  hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When\\nthey were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?\\n  \"Not much. If it should go ill with  prisoner, I have ensured\\naccess to him once.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry\\'s countenance fell.\\n  \"It is all I could do,\" said Carton. \"To propose too much, would\\nbe to put this man\\'s head under  axe, and, as he himself said,\\nnothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was\\nobviously  weakness of  position. There is no help for it.\"\\n  \"But access to him,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"if it should go ill before \\nTribunal, will not save him.\"\\n  \"I never said it would.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry\\'s eyes gradually sought  fire; his sympathy with his\\ndarling, and  heavy disappointment of his second arrest,\\ngradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety\\nof late, and his tears fell.\\n  \"You are a good man and a true friend,\" said Carton, in an altered\\nvoice. \"Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not\\nsee my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your\\nsorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,\\nhowever.\"\\n  Though he said  last words, with a slip into his usual manner,\\nthere was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his\\ntouch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen  better side of him,\\nwas wholly unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently\\npressed it.\\n  \"To return to to poor Darnay,\" said Carton. \"Don\\'t tell Her of\\nthis interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go\\nto see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of  worse, to\\nconvey to him  means of anticipating  sentence.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton\\nto see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned \\nlook, and evidently understood it.\\n  \"She might think a thousand things,\" Carton said, \"and any of them\\nwould only add to her trouble. Don\\'t speak of me to her. As I said\\nto you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my\\nhand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can\\nfind to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be\\nvery desolate to-night.\"\\n  \"I am going now, directly.\"\\n  \"I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and\\nreliance on you. How does she look?\"\\n  \"Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.\"\\n  \"Ah!\"\\n  It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh- almost like a sob. It\\nattracted Mr. Lorry\\'s eyes to Carton\\'s face, which was turned to \\nfire. A light, or a shade ( old gentleman could not have said\\nwhich), passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a\\nhill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one\\nof  little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore \\nwhite riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and  light of \\nfire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his\\nlong brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His\\nindifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of\\nremonstrance from Mr. Lorry; his boot was still upon  hot embers of\\n flaming log, when it had broken under  weight of his foot.\\n  \"I forgot it,\" he said.\\n  Mr. Lorry\\'s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of\\n wasted air which clouded  naturally handsome features, and\\nhaving  expression of prisoners\\' faces fresh in his mind, he was\\nstrongly reminded of that expression.\\n  \"And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?\" said Carton,\\nturning to him.\\n  \"Yes. As I was telling you last night when ucie came in so\\nunexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to\\nhave left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I\\nhave my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.\"\\n  They were both silent.\\n  \"Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?\" said Carton,\\nwistfully.\\n  \"I am in my seventy-eighth year.\"\\n  \"You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly\\noccupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?\"\\n  \"I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man.\\nIndeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.\"\\n  \"See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will\\nmiss you when you leave it empty!\"\\n  \"A solitary old bachelor,\" answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head.\\n\"There is nobody to weep for me.\"\\n  \"How can you say that? Wouldn\\'t She weep for you? Wouldn\\'t her\\nchild?\"\\n  \"Yes, yes, thank God. I didn\\'t quite mean what I said.\"\\n  \"It is a thing to thank God for; is it not?\"\\n  \"Surely, surely.\"\\n  \"If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,\\n\\'I have secured to myself  love and attachment,  gratitude or\\nrespect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in\\nno regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered\\nby!\\' your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses;\\nwould they not?\"\\n  \"You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.\"\\n  Sydney turned his eyes again upon  fire, and, after a silence\\nof a few moments, said:\\n  \"I should like to ask you:- Does your childhood seem far off? Do \\ndays when you sat at your mother\\'s knee, seem days of very long ago?\"\\n  Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:\\n  \"Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw\\ncloser and closer to  end, I travel in  circle, nearer and\\nnearer to  beginning. It seems to be one of  kind smoothings and\\npreparings of  way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances\\nthat had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so\\nold!), and by many associations of  days when what we call \\nWorld was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in\\nme.\"\\n  \"I understand  feeling!\" exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush.\\n\"And you are  better for it?\"\\n  \"I hope so.\"\\n  Carton terminated  conversation here, by rising to help him on\\nwith his outer coat; \"But you,\" said Mr. Lorry, reverting to \\ntheme, \"you are young.\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said Carton. \"I am not old, but my young way was never \\nway to age. Enough of me.\"\\n  \"And of me, I am sure,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Are you going out?\"\\n  \"I\\'ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless\\nhabits. If I should prowl about  streets a long time, don\\'t be\\nuneasy; I shall reappear in  morning. You go to  Court\\nto-morrow?\"\\n  \"Yes, unhappily.\"\\n  \"I shall be there, but only as one of  crowd. My Spy will find\\na place for me. Take my arm, sir.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in \\nstreets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry\\'s destination. Carton\\nleft him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back\\nto  gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of\\nher going to  prison every day. \"She came out here,\" he said,\\nlooking about him, \"turned this way, must have trod on these stones\\noften. Let me follow in her steps.\"\\n  It was ten o\\'clock at night when he stood before  prison of La\\nForce, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer,\\nhaving closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.\\n  \"Good night, citizen,\" said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for,\\n man eyed him inquisitively.\\n  \"Good night, citizen.\"\\n  \"How goes  Republic?\"\\n  \"You mean  Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall\\nmount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of\\nbeing exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a\\nBarber!\"\\n  \"Do you often go to see him--\"\\n  \"Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at\\nwork?\"\\n  \"Never.\"\\n  \"Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,\\ncitizen; he shaved  sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes!\\nLess than two pipes. Word of honour!\"\\n  As  grinning little man held out  pipe he was smoking, to\\nexplain how he timed  executioner, Carton was so sensible of a\\nrising desire to strike  life out of him, that he turned away.\\n  \"But you are not English,\" said  wood-sawyer, \"though you wear\\nEnglish dress?\"\\n  \"Yes,\" said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.\\n  \"You speak like a Frenchman.\"\\n  \"I am an old student here.\"\\n  \"Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.\"\\n  \"Good night, citizen.\"\\n  \"But go and see that droll dog,\"  little man persisted, calling\\nafter him. \"And take a pipe with you!\"\\n  Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in \\nmiddle of  street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his\\npencil on a scrap of paper. Then, traversing with  decided step\\nof one who remembered  way well, several dark and dirty streets-\\nmuch dirtier than usual, for  best public thoroughfares remained\\nuncleansed in those times of terror-he stopped at a chemist\\'s shop,\\nwhich  owner was closing with his own hands. A small, dim,\\ncrooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small,\\ndim, crooked man.\\n  Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his\\ncounter, he laid  scrap of paper before him. \"Whew!\"  chemist\\nwhistled softly, as he read it. \"Hi! hi! hi!\"\\n  Sydney Carton took no heed, and  chemist said:\\n  \"For you, citizen?\"\\n  \"For me.\"\\n  \"You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know \\nconsequences of mixing them?\"\\n  \"Perfectly.\"\\n  Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one\\nby one, in  breast of his inner coat, counted out  money for\\nthem, and deliberately left  shop. \"There is nothing more to do,\"\\nsaid he, glancing upward at  moon, \"until to-morrow. I can\\'t\\nsleep.\"\\n  It was not a reckless manner,  manner in which he said these\\nwords aloud under  fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more\\nexpressive of negligence than defiance. It was  settled manner of a\\ntired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at\\nlength struck into his road and saw its end.\\n  Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors\\nas a youth of great promise, he had his father to  grave. His\\nmother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been read\\nat his father\\'s grave, arose in his mind as he went down  dark\\nstreets, among  heavy shadows, with  moon and  clouds sailing\\non high above him. \"I am  resurrection and  life, saith \\nLord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\\nand whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.\"\\n  In a city dominated by  axe, alone at night, with natural\\nsorrow rising in him for  sixty-three who had been that day put\\nto death, and for to-morrow\\'s victims then awaiting their doom in\\n prisons, and still of to-morrow\\'s and to-morrow\\'s,  chain of\\nassociation that brought  words home, like a rusty old ship\\'s\\nanchor from  deep, might have been easily found. He did not seek\\nit, but repeated them and went on.\\n  With a solemn interest in  lighted windows where  people\\nwere going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of \\nhorrors surrounding them; in  towers of  churches, where no\\nprayers were said, for  popular revulsion had even travelled that\\nlength of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors,\\nplunderers, and profligates; in  distant burial-places, reserved,\\nas they wrote upon  gates, for Eternal Sleep; in  abounding\\ngaols; and in  streets along which  sixties rolled to a death\\nwhich had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of\\na haunting Spirit ever arose among  people out of all  working\\nof  Guillotine; with a solemn interest in  whole life and\\ndeath of  city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury;\\nSydney Carton crossed  Seine again for  lighter streets.\\n  Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be\\nsuspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on\\nheavy shoes, and trudged. But,  theatres were all well filled,\\nand  people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting\\nhome. At one of  theatre doors, there was a little girl with a\\nmother, looking for a way across  street through  mud. He\\ncarried  child over, and before  timid arm was loosed from his\\nneck asked her for a kiss.\\n  \"I am  resurrection and  life, saith  Lord: he that\\nbelieveth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever\\nliveth and believeth in me, shall never die.\"\\n  Now, that  streets were quiet, and  night wore on,  words\\nwere in  echoes of his feet, and were in  air. Perfectly calm\\nand steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but,\\nhe heard them always.\\n  The night wore out, and, as he stood upon  bridge listening to\\n water as it splashed  river-walls of  Island of Paris, where\\n picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in\\n light of  moon,  day came coldly, looking like a dead face\\nout of  sky. Then,  night, with  moon and  stars, turned\\npale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were\\ndelivered over to Death\\'s dominion.\\n  But,  glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that\\nburden of  night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright\\nrays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of\\nlight appeared to span  air between him and  sun, while \\nriver sparkled under it.\\n  The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a\\ncongenial friend, in  morning stillness He walked by  stream,\\nfar from  houses, and in  light and warmth of  sun fell\\nasleep on  bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered\\nthere yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned\\npurposeless, until  stream absorbed it, and carried it on to \\nsea.- \"Like me!\"\\n  A trading-boat, with a sail of  softened colour of a dead leaf,\\nthen glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its\\nsilent track in  water disappeared,  prayer that had broken up\\nout of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor\\nblindnesses and errors, ended in  words, \"I am  resurrection and\\n life.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to\\nsurmise where  good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing\\nbut a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to\\nrefresh himself, went out to  place of trial.\\n  The court was all astir and a-buzz, when  black sheep- whom\\nmany fell away from in dread- pressed him into an obscure corner among\\n crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She\\nwas there, sitting beside her father.\\n  When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so\\nsustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying\\ntenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called  healthy\\nblood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If\\nthere had been any eyes to notice  influence of her look, on Sydney\\nCarton, it would have been seen to be  same influence exactly.\\n  Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of\\nprocedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing.\\nThere could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and\\nceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that \\nsuicidal vengeance of  Revolution was to scatter them all to \\nwinds.\\n  Every eye was turned to  jury. The same determined patriots and\\ngood republicans as yesterday and  day before, and to-morrow and\\n day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a\\ncraving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips,\\nwhose appearance gave great satisfaction to  spectators. A\\nlife-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman,  Jacques\\nThree of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empanelled\\nto try  deer.\\n  Every eye then turned to  five judges and  public\\nprosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell,\\nuncompromising, murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then\\nsought some other eye in  crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and\\nheads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained\\nattention.\\n  Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused\\nand retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night.\\nSuspected and Denounced enemy of  Republic, Aristocrat, one of a\\nfamily of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used\\ntheir abolished privileges to  infamous oppression of  people.\\nCharles Evremonde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription,\\nabsolutely Dead in Law.\\n  To this effect, in as few or fewer words,  Public Prosecutor.\\n  The President asked, was  Accused openly denounced or secretly?\\n  \"Openly, President.\"\\n  \"By whom?\"\\n  \"Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.\"\\n  \"Good.\\n \"Therese Defarge, his wife.\"\\n  \"Good.\"\\n  \"Alexandre Manette, physician.\"\\n  A great uproar took place in  court, and in  midst of it,\\nDoctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had\\nbeen seated.\\n  \"President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery\\nand a fraud. You know  accused to be  husband of my daughter. My\\ndaughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life.\\nWho and where is  false conspirator who says that I denounce \\nhusband of my child!\"\\n  \"Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to \\nauthority of  Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to\\nwhat is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good\\ncitizen as  Republic.\"\\n  Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell,\\nand with warmth resumed.\\n  \"If  Republic should demand of you  sacrifice of your child\\nherself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what\\nis to follow. In  meanwhile, be silent!\"\\n  Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down,\\nwith his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter\\ndrew closer to him. The craving man on  jury rubbed his hands\\ntogether, and restored  usual hand to his mouth.\\n  Defarge was produced, when  court was quiet enough to admit of\\nhis being heard, and rapidly expounded  story of \\nimprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in  Doctor\\'s\\nservice, and of  release, and of  state of  prisoner when\\nreleased and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for\\n court was quick with its work.\\n  \"You did good service at  taking of  Bastille, citizen?\"\\n  \"I believe so.\"\\n  Here, an excited woman screeched from  crowd: \"You were one of\\n best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day\\nthere, and you were among  first to enter  accursed fortress\\nwhen it fell. Patriots, I speak  truth!\"\\n  It was The Vengeance who, amidst  warm commendations of \\naudience, thus assisted  proceedings. The President rang his\\nbell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, \"I\\ndefy that bell!\" wherein she was likewise much commended.\\n  \"Inform  Tribunal of what you did that day within  Bastille,\\ncitizen.\"\\n  \"I knew,\" said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at \\nbottom of  steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at\\nhim; \"I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in\\na cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from\\nhimself. He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five,\\nNorth Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun\\nthat day, I resolve, when  place shall fall, to examine that\\ncell. It falls. I mount to  cell, with a fellow-citizen who is\\none of  Jury, directed by a gaoler. I examine it, very closely.\\nIn a hole in  chimney, where a stone has been worked out and\\nreplaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have\\nmade it my business to examine some specimens of  writing of Doctor\\nManette. This is  writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this\\npaper, in  writing of Doctor Manette, to  hands of \\nPresident.\"\\n  \"Let it be read.\"\\n  In a dead silence and stillness-  prisoner under trial looking\\nlovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with\\nsolicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on \\nreader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from  prisoner, Defarge\\nnever taking his from his feasting wife, and all  other eyes\\nthere intent upon  Doctor, who saw none of them-  paper was\\nread, as follows.\\n  X\\n  THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SHADOW\\n\\n  \"I, ALEXANDRE MANETTE, Unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais,\\nand afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my\\ndoleful cell in  Bastille, during  last month of  year, 1767.\\nI write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to\\nsecrete it in  wall of  chimney, where I have slowly and\\nlaboriously made a place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand\\nmay find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.\\n  \"These words are formed by  rusty iron point with which I write\\nwith difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from  chimney,\\nmixed with blood, in  last month of  tenth year of my captivity.\\nHope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible\\nwarnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain\\nunimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in \\npossession of my right mind- that my memory is exact and\\ncircumstantial- and that I write  truth as I shall answer for these\\nmy last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at\\n Eternal Judgment-seat.\\n  \"One cloudy moonlight night, in  third week of December (I\\nthink  twenty-second of  month) in  year 1757, I was\\nwalking on a retired part of  quay by  Seine for  refreshment\\nof  frosty air, at an hour\\'s distance from my place of residence in\\n Street of  School of Medicine, when a carriage came along\\nbehind me, driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage\\npass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put\\nout at  window, and a voice called to  driver to stop.\\n  \"The carriage stopped as soon as  driver could rein in his\\nhorses, and  same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The\\ncarriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had\\ntime to open  door and alight before I came up with it. I\\nobserved that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to\\nconceal themselves. As they stood side by side near  carriage door,\\nI also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather\\nyounger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner,\\nvoice, and (as far as I could see) face too.\\n  \"\\'You are Doctor Manette?\\' said one.\\n  \"\\'I am.\\'\\n  \"\\'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,\\' said  other; \\'\\nyoung physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within  last\\nyear or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?\\'\\n  \"\\'Gentlemen,\\' I returned, \\'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you\\nspeak so graciously.\\'\\n  \"\\'We have been to your residence,\\' said  first, \\'and not being so\\nfortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were\\nprobably walking in this direction, we followed, in  hope of\\novertaking you. Will you please to enter  carriage?\\'\\n  \"The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these\\nwords were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and \\ncarriage door. They were armed. I was not.\\n  \"\\'Gentlemen,\\' said I, \\'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does\\nme  honour to seek my assistance, and what is  nature of \\ncase to which I am summoned.\\'\\n  \"The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. \\'Doctor,\\nyour clients are, people of condition. As to  nature of  case,\\nour confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for\\nyourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to\\nenter  carriage?\\'\\n  \"I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They\\nboth entered after me-  last springing in, after putting up \\nsteps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.\\n  \"I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no\\ndoubt that it is, word for word,  same. I describe everything\\nexactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from\\n task. Where I make  broken marks that follow here, I leave\\noff for  time, and put my paper in its hiding-place. * * * *\\n  \"The carriage left  streets behind, passed  North Barrier, and\\nemerged upon  country road. At two-thirds of a league from \\nBarrier- I did not estimate  distance at that time, but\\nafterwards when I traversed it- it struck out of  main avenue,\\nand presently stopped at a solitary house. We all three alighted,\\nand walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected\\nfountain had overflowed, to  door of  house. It was not opened\\nimmediately, in answer to  ringing of  bell, and one of my two\\nconductors struck  man who opened it, with his heavy riding\\nglove, across  face.\\n  \"There was nothing in this action to attract my particular\\nattention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than\\ndogs. But,  other of  two, being angry likewise, struck \\nman in like manner with his arm;  look and bearing of \\nbrothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived\\nthem to be twin brothers.\\n  \"From  time of our alighting at  outer gate (which we found\\nlocked, and which one of  brothers had opened to admit us, and\\nhad relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I\\nwas conducted to this chamber straight,  cries growing louder as we\\nascended  stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of \\nbrain, lying on a bed.\\n  \"The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not\\nmuch past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were\\nbound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these\\nbonds were all portions of a gentleman\\'s dress. On one of them,\\nwhich was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw \\narmorial bearings of a Noble, and  letter E.\\n  \"I saw this, within  first minute of my contemplation of \\npatient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her\\nface on  edge of  bed, had drawn  end of  scarf into her\\nmouth, and was in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out\\nmy hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving  scarf aside, \\nembroidery in  corner caught my sight.\\n  \"I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm\\nher and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated\\nand wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated\\n words, \\'My husband, my father, and my brother!\\' and then counted\\nup to twelve, and said, \\'Hush!\\' For an instant, and no more, she would\\npause to listen, and then  piercing shrieks would begin again,\\nand she would repeat  cry, \\'My husband, my father, and my brother!\\'\\nand would count up to twelve, and say, \\'Hush!\\' There was no\\nvariation in  order, or  manner. There was no cessation, but \\nregular moment\\'s pause, in  utterance of these sounds.\\n  \"\\'How long,\\' I asked, \\'has this lasted?\\'\\n  \"To distinguish  brothers, I will call them  elder and \\nyounger; by  elder, I mean him who exercised  most authority. It\\nwas  elder who replied, \\'Since about this hour last night.\\'\\n  \"\\'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?\\'\\n  \"\\'A brother.\\'\\n  \"\\'I do not address her brother?\\'\\n  \"He answered with great contempt, \\'No.\\'\\n  \"\\'She has some recent association with  number twelve?\\'\\n  \"The younger brother impatiently rejoined, \\'With twelve o\\'clock?\\'\\n  \"\\'See, gentlemen,\\' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast,\\n\\'how useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was\\ncoming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be\\nlost. There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.\\'\\n  \"The elder brother looked to  younger, who said haughtily, \\'There\\nis a case of medicines here;\\' and brought it from a closet, and put it\\non  table. * * * *\\n  \"I opened some of  bottles, smelt them, and put  stoppers to\\nmy lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines\\nthat were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any\\nof those.\\n  \"\\'Do you doubt them?\\' asked  younger brother.\\n  \"\\'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,\\' I replied, and said no\\nmore.\\n  \"I made  patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many\\nefforts,  dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it\\nafter a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I\\nthen sat down by  side of  bed. There was a timid and suppressed\\nwoman in attendance (wife of  man down-stairs), who had retreated\\ninto a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently\\nfurnished- evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some\\nthick old hangings had been nailed up before  windows, to deaden\\n sound of  shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their\\nregular succession, with  cry, \\'My husband, my father, and my\\nbrother!\\'  counting up to twelve, and \\'Hush!\\' The frenzy was so\\nviolent, that I had not unfastened  bandages restraining \\narms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful.\\nThe only spark of encouragement in  case, was, that my hand upon\\n sufferer\\'s breast had this much soothing influence, that for\\nminutes at a time it tranquillised  figure. It had no effect upon\\n cries; no pendulum could be more regular.\\n  \"For  reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat\\nby  side of  bed for half an hour, with  two brothers looking\\non, before  elder said:\\n  \"\\'There is another patient.\\'\\n  \"I was startled, and asked, \\'Is it a pressing case?\\'\\n  \"\\'You had better see,\\' he carelessly answered; and took up a\\nlight. * * * *\\n  \"The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase,\\nwhich was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered\\nceiling to a part of it;  rest was open, to  ridge of \\ntiled roof, and there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored\\nin that portion of  place, fagots for firing, and a heap of\\napples in sand. I had to pass through that part, to get at \\nother. My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. I try it with these\\ndetails, and I see them all, in this my cell in  Bastille, near \\nclose of  tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.\\n  \"On some hay on  ground, with a cushion thrown under his head,\\nlay a handsome peasant boy- a boy of not more than seventeen at \\nmost. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand\\nclenched on his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight\\nupward. I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one\\nknee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a\\nsharp point.\\n  \"\\'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,\\' said I. \\'Let me examine it.\\'\\n  \"\\'I do not want it examined,\\' he answered; \\'let it be.\\'\\n  \"It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand\\naway. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to\\ntwenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it\\nhad been looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I\\nturned my eyes to  elder brother, I saw him looking down at this\\nhandsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded\\nbird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.\\n  \"\\'How has this been done, monsieur?\\' said I.\\n  \"\\'A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw\\nupon him, and has fallen by my brother\\'s sword- like a gentleman.\\'\\n  \"There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this\\nanswer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient\\nto have that different order of creature dying there, and that it\\nwould have been better if he had died in  usual obscure routine\\nof his vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate\\nfeeling about  boy, or about his fate.\\n  \"The boy\\'s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they\\nnow slowly moved to me.\\n  \"\\'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs\\nare proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill\\nus; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. She- have you seen\\nher, Doctor?\\'\\n  \"The shrieks and  cries were audible there, though subdued by \\ndistance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.\\n  \"I said, \\'I have seen her.\\'\\n  \"\\'She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights,\\nthese Nobles, in  modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years,\\nbut we have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my\\nfather say so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good\\nyoung man, too: a tenant of his. We were all tenants of his- that\\nman\\'s who stands there. The other is his brother,  worst of a bad\\nrace.\\'\\n  \"It was with  greatest difficulty that  boy gathered bodily\\nforce to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.\\n  \"\\'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common\\ndogs are by those superior Beings- taxed by him without mercy, obliged\\nto work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill,\\nobliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and\\nforbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pinaged\\nand plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of\\nmeat, we ate it in fear, with  door barred and  shutters closed,\\nthat his people should not see it and take it from us- I say, we\\nwere so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father\\ntold us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into  world, and\\nthat what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren\\nand our miserable race die out!\\'\\n  \"I had never before seen  sense of being oppressed, bursting\\nforth like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in  people\\nsomewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in \\ndying boy.\\n  \"\\'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that\\ntime, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend\\nand comfort him in our cottage- our dog-hut, as that man would call\\nit. She had not been married many weeks, when that man\\'s brother saw\\nher and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him- for what\\nare husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good\\nand virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.\\nWhat did  two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence\\nwith her, to make her willing?\\'\\n  \"The boy\\'s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to\\n looker-on, and I saw in  two faces that all he said was true.\\nThe two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see,\\neven in this Bastille;  gentleman\\'s, all negligent indifference;\\n peasant\\'s, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.\\n  \"\\'You know, Doctor, that it is among  Rights of these Nobles to\\nharness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him\\nand drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in\\ntheir grounds all night, quieting  frogs, in order that their noble\\nsleep may not be disturbed. They kept him out in  unwholesome mists\\nat night, and ordered him back into his harness in  day. But he was\\nnot persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed- if\\nhe could find food- he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of\\n bell, and died on her bosom.\\'\\n  \"Nothing human could have beld life in  boy but his determination\\nto tell all his wrong. He forced back  gathering shadows of\\ndeath, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to\\ncover his wound.\\n  \"\\'Then, with that man\\'s permission and even with his aid, his\\nbrother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told\\nhis brother- and what that is, will not be long unknown to you,\\nDoctor, if it is now- his brother took her away- for his pleasure\\nand diversion, for a little while. I saw her pass me on  road. When\\nI took  tidings home, our father\\'s heart burst; he never spoke\\none of  words that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have\\nanother) to a place beyond  reach of this man, and where, at least,\\nshe will never be his vassal. Then, I tracked  brother here, and\\nlast night climbed in- a common dog, but sword in hand.- Where is\\n loft window? It was somewhere here?\\'\\n  \"The room was darkening to his sight;  world was narrowing around\\nhim. I glanced about me, and saw that  hay and straw were\\ntrampled over  floor, as if there had been a struggle.\\n  \"\\'She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he\\nwas dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then\\nstruck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him\\nas to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, \\nsword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself-\\nthrust at me with all his skill for his life.\\'\\n  \"My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on  fragments of\\na broken sword, lying among  hay. That weapon was a gentleman\\'s. In\\nanother place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier\\'s.\\n  \"\\'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?\\'\\n  \"\\'He is not here,\\' I said, supporting  boy, and thinking that\\nhe referred to  brother.\\n  \"\\'He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is\\n man who was here? Turn my face to him.\\'\\n  \"I did so, raising  boy\\'s head against my knee. But, invested for\\n moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely:\\nobliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.\\n  \"\\'Marquis,\\' said  boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide,\\nand his right hand raised, \\'in  days when all these things are to\\nbe answered for, I summon you and yours, to  last of your bad race,\\nto answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign\\nthat I do it. In  days when all these things are to be answered\\nfor, I summon your brother,  worst of  bad race, to answer for\\nthem separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I\\ndo it.\\'\\n  \"Twice, he put his hand to  wound in his breast, and with his\\nforefinger drew a cross in  air. He stood for an instant with \\nfinger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid\\nhim down dead. * * * *\\n  \"When I returned to  bedside of  young woman, I found her\\nraving in precisely  same order of continuity. I knew that this\\nmight last for many hours, and that it would probably end in \\nsilence of  grave.\\n  \"I repeated  medicines I had given her, and I sat at  side\\nof  bed until  night was far advanced. She never abated \\npiercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in  distinctness or\\n order of her words. They were always \\'My husband, my father, and\\nmy brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\\neleven, twelve. Hush!\\'\\n  \"This lasted twenty-six hours from  time when I first saw her.\\nI had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she\\nbegan to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that\\nopportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like \\ndead.\\n  \"It was as if  wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and\\nfearful storm. I released her arms, and called  woman to assist\\nme to compose her figure and  dress she had torn. It was then\\nthat I knew her condition to be that of one in whom  first\\nexpectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I\\nlost  little hope I had had of her.\\n  \"\\'Is she dead?\\' asked  Marquis, whom I will still describe as \\nelder brother, coming booted into  room from his horse.\\n  \"\\'Not dead,\\' said I; \\'but like to die.\\'\\n  \"\\'What strength there is in these common bodies!\\' he said, looking\\ndown at her with some curiosity.\\n  \"\\'There is prodigious strength,\\' I answered him, \\'in sorrow and\\ndespair.\\'\\n  \"He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved\\na chair with his foot near to mine, ordered  woman away, and said\\nin a subdued voice,\\n  \"\\'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds,\\nI recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is\\nhigh, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are\\nprobably mindful of your interest.

There was life, and no more. Looking round as I\\nresumed my seat, I found both  brothers intent upon me. * * * *\\n  \"I write with so much difficulty,  cold is so severe, I am so\\nfearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and\\ntotal darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no\\nconfusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail,\\nevery word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.\\n  \"She lingered for a week. Towards  last, I could understand\\nsome few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her\\nlips. She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I\\ntold her. It was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She\\nfaintly shook her head upon  pillow, and kept her secret, as \\nboy had done.\\n  \"I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told\\n brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day.\\nUntil then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save\\n woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat\\nbehind  curtain at  head of  bed when I was there.

The only consideration that appeared to affect \\nmind of either of them was  consideration that this was highly\\ndegrading to  family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught\\n younger brother\\'s eyes, their expression reminded me that he\\ndisliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from  boy. He was\\nsmoother and more polite to me than  elder; but I saw this. I\\nalso saw that I was an incumbrance in  mind of  elder, too.\\n  \"My patient died, two hours before midnight- at a time, by my watch,\\nanswering almost to  minute when I had first seen her.

I had heard them, alone at  bedside, striking their\\nboots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.\\n  \"\\'At last she is dead?\\' said  elder, when I went in.\\n  \"\\'She is dead,\\' said I.\\n  \"\\'I congratulate you, my brother,\\' were his words as he turned\\nround.\\n  \"He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking.

I decided, that day, to write\\nprivately to  Minister, stating  nature of  two cases to\\nwhich I had been summoned, and  place to which I had gone: in\\neffect, stating all  circumstances. I knew what Court influence\\nwas, and what  immunities of  Nobles were, and I expected that\\n matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own\\nmind. I had kept  matter a profound secret, even from my wife;\\nand this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension\\nwhatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be\\ndanger for others, if others were compromised by possessing \\nknowledge that I possessed.\\n  \"I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter\\nthat night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish\\nit. It was  last day of  year. The letter was lying before me\\njust completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to\\nsee me. * * * *\\n   \"I am growing more and more unequal to  task I have set\\nmyself.

She had in part\\nsuspected, and in part discovered,  main facts of  cruel\\nstory, of her husband\\'s share in it, and my being resorted to. She did\\nnot know that  girl was dead. Her hope had been, she said in\\ngreat distress, to show her, in secret, a woman\\'s sympathy. Her hope\\nhad been to avert  wrath of Heaven from a House that had long\\nbeen hateful to  suffering many.\\n  \"She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living,\\nand her greatest desire was, to help that sister.

The quick noise and movement of \\ncourt\\'s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie\\nstood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her\\nface but love and consolation.\\n  \"If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good\\ncitizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!\"\\n  There was but a gaoler left, along with two of  four men who\\nhad taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to\\n show in  streets. Barsad proposed to  rest, \"Let her embrace\\nhim then; it is but a moment.\" It was silently acquiesced in, and they\\npassed her over  seats in  hall to a raised place, where he,\\nby leaning over  dock, could fold her in his arms.\\n  \"Farewell, dear darling of my soul.

His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.\\nYet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity- that had a\\nflush of pride in it.\\n  \"Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.\"\\n  He carried her lightly to  door, and laid her tenderly down in\\na coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took\\nhis seat beside  driver.\\n  When they arrived at  gateway where he had paused in  dark not\\nmany hours before, to picture to himself on which of  rough\\nstones of  street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and\\ncarried her up rhe staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down\\non a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.\\n  \"Don\\'t recall her to herself,\" he said, softly, to  latter,\\n\"she is better so. Don\\'t revive her to consciousness, while she only\\nfaints.\"\\n  \"Oh, Carton, Carton, Carton!\" cried little Lucie, springing up and\\nthrowing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. \"Now\\nthat you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma,\\nsomething to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all\\n people who love her, bear to see her so?\"\\n  He bent over  child, and laid her blooming cheek against his\\nface. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious\\nmother.\\n  \"Before I go,\" he said, and paused- \"I may kiss her?\"\\n  It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched\\nher face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was\\nnearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren\\nwhen she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, \"A life\\nyou love.\"\\n  When he had gone out into  next room, he turned suddenly on Mr.\\nLorry and her father, who were following, and said to  latter:\\n  \"You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at\\nleast be tried. These judges, and all  men in power, are very\\nfriendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\"\\n  \"Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had \\nstrongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.\" He returned\\n answer in great trouble, and very slowly.\\n  \"Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon\\nare few and short, but try.\"\\n  \"I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.\"\\n  \"That\\'s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things\\nbefore now- though never,\" he added, with a smile and a sigh together,\\n\"such great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when\\nwe misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay\\ndown if it were not.\"\\n  \"I will go,\" said Doctor Manette, \"to  Prosecutor and \\nPresident straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to\\nname. I will write too, and- But stay! There is a celebration in \\nstreets, and no one will be accessible until dark.\"\\n  \"That\\'s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at  best, and not much\\n forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how\\nyou speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have\\nseen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?\"\\n  \"Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from\\nthis.\"\\n  \"It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch  hour or two. If\\nI go to Mr. Lorry\\'s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either\\nfrom our friend or from yourself?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"May you prosper!\"\\n  Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to  outer door, and, touching him on\\n shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.\\n  \"I have no hope,\" said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.\\n  \"Nor have I.\"\\n  \"If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to\\nspare him- which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or\\nany man\\'s to them!- I doubt if they durst spare him after \\ndemonstration in  court.\"\\n  \"And so do I. I heard  fall of  axe in that sound.\"\\n  Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon  door-post, and bowed his face upon\\nit.\\n  \"Don\\'t despond,\" said Carton, very gently; \"don\\'t grieve. I\\nencouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might\\none day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think \\'his life\\nwas wantonly thrown away or wasted,\\' and that might trouble her.\"\\n  \"Yes, yes, yes,\" returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, \"you are\\nright.\\n  But he will perish; there is no real hope.\"\\n  \"Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope,\" echoed Carton. And\\nwalked with a settled step, down-stairs.\\n  XII\\n  DARKNESS\\n\\n  SYDNEY CARTON paused in  street, not quite decided where to go.\\n\"At Tellson\\'s banking-house at nine,\" he said, with a musing face.\\n\"Shall I do well, in  mean time, to show myself? I think so. It\\nis best that these people should know there is such a man as I here;\\nit is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But\\ncare, care, Let me think it out!\"\\n  Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he\\ntook a turn or two in  already darkening street, and traced \\nthought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression\\nwas confirmed. \"It is best,\" he said, finally resolved, \"that these\\npeople should know there is such a man as I here.\" And he turned his\\nface towards Saint Antoine.\\n  Defarge had described himself, that day, as  keeper of a\\nwine-shop in  Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one\\nwho knew  city well, to find his house without asking any question.\\nHaving ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer\\nstreets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound\\nasleep after dinner. For  first time in many years, he had no\\nstrong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light\\nthin wine, and last night he had dropped  brandy slowly down on Mr.\\nLorry\\'s hearth like a man who had done with it.\\n  It was as late as seven o\\'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went\\nout into  streets again. As he passed along towards Saint\\nAntoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and\\nslightly altered  disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and\\nhis coat-collar, and his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to\\nDefarge\\'s, and went in.\\n  There happened to be no customer in  shop but Jacques Three, of\\n restless fingers and  croaking voice. This man, whom he had\\nseen upon  Jury, stood drinking at  little counter, in\\nconversation with  Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted\\nin  conversation, like a regular member of  establishment.\\n  As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent\\nFrench) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless\\nglance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced\\nto him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.\\n  He repeated what he had already said.\\n  \"English?\" asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark\\neyebrows.\\n  After looking at her, as if  sound of even a single French word\\nwere slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former\\nstrong foreign accent. \"Yes, madame, yes. I am English!\"\\n  Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get  wine, and, as he\\ntook up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its\\nmeaning, he heard her say, \"I swear to you, like Evremonde!\"\\n  Defarge brought him  wine, and gave him Good Evening.\\n  \"How?\"\\n  \"Good evening.\"\\n  \"Oh! Good evening, citizen,\" filling his glass. \"Ah! and good\\nwine. I drink to  Republic.\"\\n  Defarge went back to  counter, and said, \"Certainly, a little\\nlike.\" Madame sternly retorted, \"I tell you a good deal like.\" Jacques\\nThree pacifically remarked, \"He is so much in your mind, see you,\\nmadame.\" The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, \"Yes, my faith!\\nAnd you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once\\nmore to-morrow!\"\\n  Carton followed  lines and words of his paper, with a slow\\nforefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all\\nleaning their arms on  counter close together, speaking low.\\nAfter a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards\\nhim without disturbing his outward attention from  Jacobin\\neditor, they resumed their conversation.\\n  \"It is true what madame says,\" observed Jacques Three. \"Why stop?\\nThere is great force in that. Why stop?\"\\n  \"Well, well,\" reasoned Defarge, \"but one must stop somewhere.\\nAfter all,  question is still where?\"\\n  \"At extermination,\" said madame.\\n  \"Magnificent!\" croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly\\napproved.\\n  \"Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,\" said Defarge, rather\\ntroubled; \"in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has\\nsuffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face\\nwhen  paper was read.\"\\n  \"I have observed his face!\" repeated madame, contemptuously and\\nangrily. \"Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to\\nbe not  face of a true friend of  Republic. Let him take care of\\nhis face!\"\\n  \"And you have observed, my wife,\" said Defarge, in a deprecatory\\nmanner, \" anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish\\nto him!\"\\n  \"I have observed his daughter,\" repeated madame; \"yes, I have\\nobserved his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her\\nto-day, and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in \\ncourt, and I have observed her in  street by  prison. Let me but\\nlift my finger--!\" She seemed to raise it ( listener\\'s eyes were\\nalways on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on  ledge\\nbefore her, as if  axe had dropped.\\n  \"The citizeness is superb!\" croaked  Juryman.\\n  \"She is an Angel!\" said The Vengeance, and embraced her.\\n  \"As to thee,\" pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband,\\n\"if it depended on thee- which, happily, it does not- thou wouldst\\nrescue this man even now.\"\\n  \"No!\" protested Defarge. \"Not if to lift this glass would do it! But\\nI would leave  matter there. I say, stop there.\"\\n  \"See you then, Jacques,\" said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; \"and see\\nyou, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other\\ncrimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my\\nregister, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband,\\nis that so.\"\\n  \"It is so,\" assented Defarge, without being asked.\\n  \"In  beginning of  great days, when  Bastille falls, he\\nfinds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in  middle\\nof  night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on\\nthis spot, by  light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.\"\\n  \"It is so,\" assented Defarge.\\n  \"That night, I tell him, when  paper is read through, and \\nlamp is burnt out, and  day is gleaming in above those shutters and\\nbetween those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate.\\nAsk him, is that so.\"\\n  \"It is so,\" assented Defarge again.\\n  \"I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two\\nhands as I smite it now, and I tell him, \\'Defarge, I was brought up\\namong  fishermen of  sea-shore, and that peasant family so\\ninjured by  two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper\\ndescribes, is my family. Defarge, that sister of  mortally\\nwounded boy upon  ground was my sister, that husband was my\\nsister\\'s husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother\\nwas my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and\\nthat summons to answer for those things descends to me!\\' Ask him, is\\nthat so.\"\\n  \"It is so,\" assented Defarge once more.\\n  \"Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,\" returned madame; \"but don\\'t\\ntell me.\"\\n  Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from  deadly nature\\nof her wrath-  listener could feel how white she was, without\\nseeing her- and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority,\\ninterposed a few words for  memory of  compassionate wife of \\nMarquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her\\nlast reply. \"Tell  Wind and  Fire where to stop; not me!\"\\n  Customers entered, and  group was broken up. The English customer\\npaid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked,\\nas a stranger, to be directed towards  National Palace. Madame\\nDefarge took him to  door, and put her arm on his, in pointing\\nout  road. The English customer was not without his reflections\\nthen, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and\\nstrike under it sharp and deep.\\n  But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in  shadow of \\nprison wall. At  appointed hour, he emerged from it to present\\nhimself in Mr. Lorry\\'s room again, where he found  old gentleman\\nwalking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie\\nuntil just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and\\nkeep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted\\n banking-house towards four o\\'clock. She had some faint hopes\\nthat his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He\\nhad been more than five hours gone: where could he be?\\n  Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and\\nhe being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that\\nhe should go back to her, and come to  banking-house again at\\nmidnight. In  meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by  fire for\\n Doctor.\\n  He waited and waited, and  clock struck twelve; but Doctor\\nManette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of\\nhim, and brought none. Where could he be?\\n  They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some\\nweak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him\\non  stairs. The instant he entered  room, it was plain that\\nall was lost.\\n  Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been an\\nthat time traversing  streets, was never known. As he stood staring\\nat them, they asked him no question, for his face told them\\neverything.\\n  \"I cannot find it,\" said he, \"and I must have it. Where is it?\"\\n  His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look\\nstraying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on \\nfloor.\\n  \"Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and\\nI can\\'t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I\\nmust finish those shoes.\"\\n  They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.\\n  \"Come, come!\" said he, in a whimpering miserable way; \"Let me get to\\nwork. Give me my work.\"\\n  Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon \\nground, like a distracted child.\\n  \"Don\\'t torture a poor forlorn wretch,\" he implored them, with a\\ndreadful cry; \"but give me my work! What is to become of us, if\\nthose shoes are not done to-night?\"\\n  Lost, utterly lost!\\n  It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to\\nrestore him,- that- as if by agreement- they each put a hand upon\\nhis shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before  fire, with a\\npromise that he should have his work presently. He sank into \\nchair, and brooded over  embers, and shed tears. As if all that had\\nhappened since  garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr.\\nLorry saw him shrink into  exact figure that Defarge had had in\\nkeeping.\\n  Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this\\nspectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His\\nlonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to\\nthem both too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at\\none another with one meaning in their faces. Carton was  first to\\nspeak:\\n  \"The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be\\ntaken to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily\\nattend to me? Don\\'t ask me why I make  stipulations I am going to\\nmake, and exact  promise I am going to exact; I have a reason- a\\ngood one.\"\\n  \"I do not doubt it,\" answered Mr. Lorry. \"Say on.\"\\n  The figure in  chair between them, was all  time\\nmonotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in\\nsuch a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a\\nsick-bed in  night.\\n  Carton stooped to pick up  coat, which lay almost entangling\\nhis feet. As he did so, a small case in which  Doctor was\\naccustomed to carry  lists of his day\\'s duties, fell lightly on \\nfloor. Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. \"We\\nshould look at this!\" he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened\\nit, and exclaimed, \"Thank GOD!\"\\n  \"What is it?\" asked Mr. Lorry, O eagerly\\n  \"A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,\" he put his\\nhand in his coat, and took another paper from it, \"that is \\ncertificate which enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You\\nsee- Sydney Carton, an Englishman?\"\\n  Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.\\n  \"Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you\\nremember, and I had better not take it into  prison.\"\\n  \"Why not?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that\\nDoctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate,\\nenabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass\\n barrier and  frontier! You see?\"\\n  \"Yes!\"\\n  \"Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against\\nevil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don\\'t stay to\\nlook; put it up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I\\nnever doubted until within this hour or two, that he had, or could\\nhave such a paper. It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon\\nrecalled, and, I have reason to think, will be.\"\\n  \"They are not in danger?\"\\n  \"They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by\\nMadame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of\\nthat woman\\'s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in\\nstrong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen \\nspy. He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by  prison\\nwall, is under  control of  Defarges, and has been rehearsed\\nby Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her\"- he never mentioned\\nLucie\\'s name- \"making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to\\nforesee that  pretence will be  common one, a prison plot, and\\nthat it will involve her life- and perhaps her child\\'s- and perhaps\\nher father\\'s- for both have been seen with her at that place. Don\\'t\\nlook so horrified. You will save them all.\"\\n  \"Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?\"\\n  \"I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could\\ndepend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take\\nplace until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days\\nafterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a\\ncapital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of \\nGuillotine. She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of\\nthis crime, and this woman ( inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot\\nbe described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make\\nherself doubly sure. You follow me?\"\\n  \"So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that\\nfor  moment I lose sight,\" touching  back of  Doctor\\'s chair,\\n\"even of this distress.\"\\n  \"You have money, and can buy  means of travelling to  seacoast\\nas quickly as  journey can be made. Your preparations have been\\ncompleted for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have\\nyour horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o\\'clock\\nin  afternoon.\"\\n  \"It shall be done!\"\\n  His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught \\nflame, and was as quick as youth.\\n  \"You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better\\nman? Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving\\nher child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own\\nfair head beside her husband\\'s cheerfully.\" He faltered for an\\ninstant; then went on as before. \"For  sake of her child and her\\nfather, press upon her  necessity of leaving Paris, with them and\\nyou, at that hour. Tell her that it was her husband\\'s last\\narrangement. Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe,\\nor hope. You think that her father, even in this sad state, will\\nsubmit himself to her; do you not?\"\\n  \"I am sure of it.\"\\n  \"I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made\\nin  courtyard here, even to  taking of your own seat in \\ncarriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.\"\\n  \"I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?\"\\n  \"You have my certificate in your hand with  rest, you know, and\\nwill reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied,\\nand then for England!\"\\n  \"Why, then,\" said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and\\nsteady hand, \"it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall\\nhave a young and ardent man at my side.\"\\n  \"By  help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing\\nwill influence you to alter  course on which we now stand pledged\\nto one another.\"\\n  \"Nothing, Carton.\"\\n  \"Remember these words to-morrow: change  course, or delay in\\nit- for any reason- and no life can possibly be saved, and many\\nlives must inevitably be sacrificed.\"\\n  \"I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.\"\\n  \"And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!\"\\n  Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he\\neven put  old man\\'s hand to his lips, he did not part from him\\nthen. He helped him so far to arouse  rocking figure before \\ndying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it\\nforth to find where  bench and work were hidden that it still\\nmoaningly besought to have. He walked on  other side of it and\\nprotected it to  courtyard of  house where  afflicted\\nheart- so happy in  memorable time when he had revealed his own\\ndesolate heart to it- outwatched  awful night. He entered \\ncourtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at\\n light in  window of her room. Before he went away, he\\nbreathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell.\\n  XIII\\n  FIFTY-TWO\\n\\n  IN THE BLACK PRISON of  Conciergerie,  doomed of  day\\nawaited their fate. They were in number as  weeks of  year.\\nFifty-two were to roll that afternoon on  life-tide of  city\\nto  boundless everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of\\nthem, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into \\nblood spilled yesterday,  blood that was to mingle with theirs\\nto-morrow was already set apart.\\n  Two score and twelve were told off. From  farmer-general of\\nseventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to  seamstress of\\ntwenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical\\ndiseases, engendered in  vices and neglects of men, will seize on\\nvictims of all degrees; and  frightful moral disorder, born of\\nunspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless\\nindifference, smote equally without distinction.\\n  Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no\\nflattering delusion since he came to it from  Tribunal. In every\\nline of  narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation.\\nHe had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly\\nsave him, that he was virtually sentenced by  millions, and that\\nunits could avail him nothing.\\n  Nevertheless, it was not easy, with  face of his beloved wife\\nfresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold\\non life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by\\ngradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched \\ntighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand\\nand it yielded, this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in\\nall his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that\\ncontended against resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned,\\nthen his wife and child who had to live after him, seemed to protest\\nand to make it a selfish thing.\\n  But, all this was at first. Before long,  consideration that\\nthere was no disgrace in  fate he must meet, and that numbers\\nwent  same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up\\nto stimulate him. Next followed  thought that much of  future\\npeace of mind enjoyable by  dear ones, depended on his quiet\\nfortitude. So, by degrees he calmed into  better state, when he\\ncould raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.\\n  Before it had set in dark on  night of his condemnation, he had\\ntravelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase \\nmeans of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as\\n prison lamps should be extinguished.\\n  He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known\\nnothing of her father\\'s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from\\nherself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father\\'s and\\nuncle\\'s responsibility for that misery, until  paper had been read.\\nHe had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of\\n name he had relinquished, was  one condition- fully\\nintelligible now- that her father had attached to their betrothal, and\\nwas  one promise he had still exacted on  morning of their\\nmarriage. He entreated her, for her father\\'s sake, never to seek to\\nknow whether her father had become oblivious of  existence of \\npaper, or had had it recalled to him (for  moment, or for good), by\\n story of  Tower, on that old Sunday under  dear old\\nplane-tree in  garden. If he had preserved any definite remembrance\\nof it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed\\nwith  Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among  relics\\nof prisoners which  populace had discovered there, and which had\\nbeen described to all  world. He besought her- though he added that\\nhe knew it was needless- to console her father, by impressing him\\nthrough every tender means she could think of, with  truth that\\nhe had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but\\nhad uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to her\\npreservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her\\novercoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he\\nadjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.\\n  To her father himself, he wrote in  same strain; but, he told her\\nfather that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care.\\nAnd he told him this, very strongly, with  hope of rousing him from\\nany despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he\\nmight be tending.\\n  To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly\\naffairs. That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship\\nand warm attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His\\nmind was so full of  others, that he never once thought of him.\\n  He had time to finish these letters before  lights were put\\nout. When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with\\nthis world.\\n  But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining\\nforms. Free and happy, back in  old house in Soho (though it had\\nnothing in it like  real house), unaccountably released and light\\nof heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a\\ndream, and he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and\\nthen he had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at\\npeace, and yet there was no difference in him. Another pause of\\noblivion, and he awoke in  sombre morning, unconscious where he was\\nor what had happened, until it flashed upon his mind, \"this is  day\\nof my death!\"\\n  Thus, had he come through  hours, to  day when  fifty-two\\nheads were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that\\nbe could meet  end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his\\nwaking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.\\n  He had never seen  instrument that was to terminate his life. How\\nhigh it was from  ground, how many steps it had, where he would\\nbe stood, how he would be touched, whether  touching hands would be\\ndyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be\\n first, or might be  last: these and many similar questions,\\nin nowise directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over\\nagain, countless times. Neither were they connected with fear: he\\nwas conscious of no fear. Rather, they originated in a strange\\nbesetting desire to know what to do when  time came; a desire\\ngigantically disproportionate to  few swift moments to which it\\nreferred; a wondering that was more like  wondering of some other\\nspirit within his, than his own.\\n  The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and  clocks struck \\nnumbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for\\never, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a\\nhard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last\\nperplexed him, he had got  better of it. He walked up and down,\\nsoftly repeating their names to himself. The worst of  strife was\\nover. He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies,\\npraying for himself and for them.\\n  Twelve gone for ever.\\n  He had been apprised that  final hour was Three, and he knew he\\nwould be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as  tumbrils jolted\\nheavily and slowly through  streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep\\nTwo before his mind, as  hour, and so to strengthen himself in\\n interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen\\nothers.\\n  Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a\\nvery different man from  prisoner, who had walked to and fro at\\nLa Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The\\nhour had measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven\\nfor his recovered self-possession, he thought, \"There is but another\\nnow,\" and turned to walk again.\\n  Footsteps in  stone passage outside  door. He stopped.\\n  The key was put in  lock, and turned. Before  door was opened,\\nor as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: \"He has\\nnever seen me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I\\nwait near. Lose no time!\"\\n  The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him\\nface to face, quiet, intent upon him, with  light of a smile on his\\nfeatures, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.\\n  There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that,\\nfor  first moment,  prisoner misdoubted him to be an\\napparition of his own imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his\\nvoice; he took  prisoner\\'s hand, and it was his real grasp.\\n  \"Of all  people upon earth, you least expected to see me?\" he\\nsaid.\\n  \"I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now.\\nYou are not\"-  apprehension came suddenly into his mind- \"a\\nprisoner?\"\\n  \"No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of \\nkeepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her-\\nyour wife, dear Darnay.\"\\n  The prisoner wrung his hand.\\n  \"I bring you a request from her.\"\\n  \"What is it?\"\\n  \"A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you\\nin  most pathetic tones of  voice so dear to you, that you\\nwell remember.\"\\n  The prisoner turned his face partly aside.\\n  \"You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have\\nno time to tell you. You must comply with it- take off those boots you\\nwear, and draw on these of mine.\"\\n  There was a chair against  wall of  cell, behind  prisoner.\\nCarton, pressing forward, had already, with  speed of lightning,\\ngot him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.\\n  \"Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your\\nwill to them. Quick!\"\\n  \"Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done.\\nYou will only die with me. It is madness.\"\\n  \"It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I\\nask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain\\nhere. Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine.\\nWhile you do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out\\nyour hair like this of mine!\"\\n  With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and\\naction, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these\\nchanges upon him. The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.\\n  \"Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it\\nnever can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I\\nimplore you not to add your death to  bitterness of mine.\"\\n  \"Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass  door? When I ask that,\\nrefuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand\\nsteady enough to write?\"\\n  \"It was when you came in.\"\\n  \"Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend,\\nquick!\"\\n  Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at \\ntable. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside\\nhim.\\n  \"Write exactly as I speak.\"\\n  \"To whom do I address it?\"\\n  \"To no one.\" Carton still had his hand in his breast.\\n  \"Do I date it?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over\\nhim with his hand in his breast, looked down.\\n  \"\\'If you remember,\\'\" said Carton, dictating, \"\\' words that passed\\nbetween us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see\\nit. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget\\nthem.\\'\"\\n  He was drawing his hand from his breast;  prisoner chancing to\\nlook up in his hurried wonder as he wrote,  hand stopped, closing\\nupon something.\\n  \"Have you written \\'forget them\\'?\" Carton asked.\\n  \"I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\"\\n  \"No; I am not armed.\"\\n  \"What is it in your hand?\"\\n  \"You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.\"\\nHe dictated again. \"\\'I am thankful that  time has come, when I\\ncan prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.\\'\" As\\nhe said these words with his eyes fixed on  writer, his hand slowly\\nand softly moved down close to  writer\\'s face.\\n  The pen dropped from Darnay\\'s fingers on  table, and he looked\\nabout him vacantly.\\n  \"What vapour is that?\" he asked.\\n  \"Vapour?\"\\n  \"Something that crossed me?\"\\n  \"I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up \\npen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\"\\n  As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, \\nprisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton\\nwith clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton- his\\nhand again in his breast- looked steadily at him.\\n  \"Hurry, hurry!\"\\n  The prisoner bent over  paper, once more.\\n  \"\\'If it had been otherwise;\\'\" Carton\\'s hand was again watchfully and\\nsoftly stealing down; \"\\'I never should have used  longer\\nopportunity. If it had been otherwise;\\'\"  hand was at \\nprisoner\\'s face; \"\\'I should but have had so much  more to answer\\nfor. If it had been otherwise-\\'\" Carton looked at  pen and saw it\\nwas trailing off into unintelligible signs.\\n  Carton\\'s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner\\nsprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton\\'s hand was close and\\nfirm at his nostrils, and Carton\\'s left arm caught him round \\nwaist. For a few seconds he faintly struggled with  man who had\\ncome to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he\\nwas stretched insensible on  ground.\\n  Quickly, but with hands as true to  purpose as his heart was,\\nCarton dressed himself in  clothes  prisoner had laid aside,\\ncombed back his hair, and tied it with  ribbon  prisoner had\\nworn. Then, he softly called, \"Enter there! Come in!\" and  Spy\\npresented himself.\\n  \"You see?\" said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside\\n insensible figure, putting  paper in  breast: \"is your\\nhazard very great?\"\\n  \"Mr. Carton,\"  Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers,\\n\"my hazard is not that, in  thick of business here, if you are true\\nto  whole of your bargain.\"\\n  \"Don\\'t fear me. I will be true to  death.\"\\n  \"You must be, Mr. Carton, if  tale of fifty-two is to be right.\\nBeing made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.\"\\n  \"Have no fear! I shall soon be out of  way of harming you, and\\n rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance\\nand take me to  coach.\"\\n  \"You?\" said  Spy nervously.\\n  \"Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at  gate by\\nwhich you brought me in?\"\\n  \"Of course.\"\\n  \"I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now\\nyou take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a\\nthing has happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your\\nown hands. Quick! Call assistance!\"\\n  \"You swear not to betray me?\" said  trembling Spy, as he paused\\nfor a last moment.\\n  \"Man, man!\" returned Carton, stamping his foot; \"have I sworn by\\nno solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste \\nprecious moments now? Take him yourself to  courtyard you know\\nof, place him yourself in  carriage, show him yourself to Mr.\\nLorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to\\nremember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and\\ndrive away!\"\\n  The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at  table, resting\\nhis forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.\\n  \"How, then?\" said one of them, contemplating  fallen figure.\\n\"So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in  lottery\\nof Sainte Guillotine?\"\\n  \"A good patriot,\" said  other, \"could hardly have been more\\nafflicted if  Aristocrat had drawn a blank.\"\\n  They raised  unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had\\nbrought to  door, and bent to carry it away.\\n  \"The time is short, Evremonde,\" said  Spy, in a warning voice.\\n  \"I know it well,\" answered Carton. \"Be careful of my friend, I\\nentreat you, and leave me.\"\\n  \"Come, then, my children,\" said Barsad. \"Lift him, and come away!\"\\n  The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers\\nof listening to  utmost, he listened for any sound that might\\ndenote suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,\\nfootsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry\\nmade, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he\\nsat down at  table, and listened again until  clock struck Two.\\n  Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then\\nbegan to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and\\nfinally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in,\\nmerely saying, \"Follow me, Evremonde!\" and he followed into a large\\ndark room, at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with\\n shadows within, and what with  shadows without, he could but\\ndimly discern  others who were brought there to have their arms\\nbound. Some were standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in\\nrestless motion; but, these were few. The great majority were silent\\nand still, looking fixedly at  ground.\\n  As he stood by  wall in a dim corner, while some of  fifty-two\\nwere brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,\\nas having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of\\ndiscovery; but  man went on. A very few moments after that, a young\\nwoman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there\\nwas no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose\\nfrom  seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak\\nto him.\\n  \"Citizen Evremonde,\" she said, touching him with her cold hand. \"I\\nam a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.\"\\n  He murmured for answer: \"True. I forget what you were accused of?\"\\n  \"Plots. Though  just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is\\nit likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak\\ncreature like me?\\n  The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears\\nstarted from his eyes.\\n  \"I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing.\\nI am not unwilling to die, if  Republic which is to do so much good\\nto us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can\\nbe, Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!\"\\n  As  last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to,\\nit warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.\\n  \"I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?\"\\n  \"It was. But, I was again taken and condemned.\"\\n  \"If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold\\nyour hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give\\nme more courage.\"\\n  As  patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt\\nin them, and then astonishment. He pressed  work-worn,\\nhunger-worn young fingers, and touched his lips.\\n  \"Are you dying for him?\" she whispered.\\n  \"And his wife and child. Hush! Yes.\"\\n  \"O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?\"\\n  \"Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to  last.\"\\n\\n  The same shadows that are falling on  prison, are falling, in\\nthat same hour of  early afternoon, on  Barrier with  crowd\\nabout it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.\\n  \"Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!\"\\n  The papers are handed out, and read.\\n  \"Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?\"\\n  This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old\\nman pointed out.\\n  \"Apparently  Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The\\nRevolution-fever will have been too much for him?\"\\n  Greatly too much for him.\\n  \"Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is\\nshe?\"\\n  This is she.\\n  \"Apparently it must be. Lucie,  wife of Evremonde; is it not?\"\\n  It is.\\n  \"Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child.\\nEnglish. This is she?\"\\n  She and no other.\\n  \"Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good\\nRepublican; something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton.\\nAdvocate. English. Which is he?\"\\n  He lies here, in this corner of  carriage. He, too, is pointed\\nout.\\n  \"Apparently  English advocate is in a swoon?\"\\n  It is hoped he will recover in  fresher air. It is represented\\nthat he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend\\nwho is under  displeasure of  Republic.\\n  \"Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under \\ndispleasure of  Republic, and must look out at  little window.\\nJarvis Lorry.\\n  Banker. English. Which is he?\"\\n  \"I am he. Necessarily, being  last.\"\\n  It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all  previous questions. It\\nis Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on  coach\\ndoor, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round\\n carriage and leisurely mount  box, to look at what little\\nluggage it carries on  roof;  country-people hanging about,\\npress nearer to  coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child,\\ncarried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it\\nmay touch  wife of an aristocrat who has gone to  Guillotine.\\n  \"Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.\"\\n  \"One can depart, citizen?\"\\n  \"One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!\"\\n  \"I salute you, citizens.- And  first danger passed!\"\\n  These are again  words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands,\\nand looks upward. There is terror in  carriage, there is weeping,\\nthere is  heavy breathing of  insensible traveller.\\n  \"Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?\"\\nasks Lucie, clinging to  old man.\\n  \"It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too\\nmuch; it would rouse suspicion.\"\\n  \"Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!\"\\n  \"The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.\"\\n  Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous\\nbuildings, dye-works, tanneries, and  like, open country, avenues\\nof leafless trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us,  soft deep\\nmud is on either side. Sometimes, we strike into  skirting mud,\\nto avoid  stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we\\nstick in ruts and sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then\\nso great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out\\nand running- hiding- doing anything but stopping.\\n  Out of  open country, in again among ruinous buildings,\\nsolitary farms, dye-works, tanneries, and  like, cottages in twos\\nand threes, avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and\\ntaken us back by another road? Is not this  same place twice\\nover? Thank Heaven, no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we\\nare pursued! Hush!  posting-house.\\n  Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely,  coach\\nstands in  little street, bereft of horses, and with no\\nlikelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely,  new horses\\ncome into visible existence, one by one; leisurely,  new postilions\\nfollow, sucking, and plaiting  lashes of their whips; leisurely,\\n old postilions count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive\\nat dissatisfied results. All  time, our overfraught hearts are\\nbeating at a rate that would far outstrip  fastest gallop of \\nfastest horses ever foaled.\\n  At length  new postilions are in their saddles, and  old are\\nleft behind. We are through  village, up  hill, and down \\nhill, and on  low watery grounds. Suddenly,  postilions exchange\\nspeech with animated gesticulation, and  horses are pulled up,\\nalmost on their haunches. We are pursued?\\n  \"Ho! Within  carriage there. Speak then!\"\\n  \"What is it?\" asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.\\n  \"How many did they say?\"\\n  \"I do not understand you.\"\\n  \"-At  last post. How many to  Guillotine to-day?\"\\n  \"Fifty-two.\"\\n  \"I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it\\nforty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes\\nhandsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!\"\\n  The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive,\\nand to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he\\nasks him, by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind\\nHeaven, and help us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.\\n  The wind is rushing after us, and  clouds are flying after us,\\nand  moon is plunging after us, and  whole wild night is in\\npursuit of us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.\\n  XIV\\n  THE KNITTING DONE\\n\\n  IN THAT SAME JUNCTURE Of time when  Fifty-Two awaited their\\nfate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and\\nJacques Three of  Revolutionary Jury. Not in  wine-shop did\\nMadame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in  shed of \\nwoodsawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not\\nparticipate in  conference, but abided at a little distance, like\\nan outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an\\nopinion until invited.\\n  \"But our Defarge,\" said Jacques Three, \"is undoubtedly a good\\nRepublican? Eh?\"\\n  \"There is no better,\"  voluble Vengeance protested in her\\nshrill notes, \"in France.\"\\n  \"Peace, little Vengeance,\" said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with\\na slight frown on her lieutenant\\'s lips, \"hear me speak. My husband,\\nfellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved\\nwell of  Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has\\nhis weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.\"\\n  \"It is a great pity,\" croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his\\nhead, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; \"it is not quite\\nlike a good citizen; it is a thing to regret.\"\\n  \"See you,\" said madame, \"I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may\\nwear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all\\none to me. But,  Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and \\nwife and child must follow  husband and father.\"\\n  \"She has a fine head for it,\" croaked Jacques Three. \"I have seen\\nblue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when\\nSamson held them up.\" Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.\\n  Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.\\n  \"The child also,\" observed Jacques Three, with a meditative\\nenjoyment of his words, \"has golden hair and blue eyes. And we\\nseldom have a child there. It is a pretty sight!\"\\n  \"In a word,\" said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short\\nabstraction, \"I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do\\nI feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him  details\\nof my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of\\nhis giving warning, and then they might escape.\"\\n  \"That must never be,\" croaked Jacques Three; \"no one must escape. We\\nhave not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.\"\\n  \"In a word,\" Madame Defarge went on, \"my husband has not my reason\\nfor pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason\\nfor regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,\\ntherefore. Come hither, little citizen.\"\\n  The wood-sawyer, who held her in  respect, and himself in \\nsubmission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.\\n  \"Touching those signals, little citizen,\" said Madame Defarge,\\nsternly, \"that she made to  prisoners; you are ready to bear\\nwitness to them this very day?\"\\n  \"Ay, ay, why not!\" cried  sawyer. \"Every day, in all weathers,\\nfrom two to four, always signalling, sometimes with  little one,\\nsometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.\"\\n  He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental\\nimitation of some few of  great diversity of signals that he had\\nnever seen.\\n  \"Clearly plots,\" said Jacques Three. \"Transparently!\"\\n  \"There is no doubt of  Jury?\" inquired Madame Defarge, letting\\nher eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.\\n  \"Rely upon  patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my\\nfellow Jurymen.\"\\n  \"Now, let me see,\" said Madame Defarge, pondering again. \"Yet once\\nmore! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling\\neither way. Can I spare him?\"\\n  \"He would count as one head,\" observed Jacques Three, in a low\\nvoice. \"We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.\"\\n  \"He was signalling with her when I saw her,\" argued Madame\\nDefarge; \"I cannot speak of one without  other; and I must not be\\nsilent, and trust  case wholly to him, this little citizen here.\\nFor, I am not a bad witness.\"\\n  The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their\\nfervent protestations that she was  most admirable and marvellous\\nof witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to\\nbe a celestial witness.\\n  \"He must take his chance,\" said Madame Defarge. \"No, I cannot\\nspare him! You are engaged at three o\\'clock; you are going to see\\n batch of to-day executed.- You?\"\\n  The question was addressed to  wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied\\nin  affirmative: seizing  occasion to add that he was  most\\nardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect  most\\ndesolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying \\npleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in  contemplation of \\ndroll national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he\\nmight have been suspected (perhaps was, by  dark eyes that looked\\ncontemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge\\'s head) of having his\\nsmall individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in\\n day.\\n  \"I,\" said madame, \"am equally engaged at  same place. After it is\\nover- say at eight to-night- come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and\\nwe will give information against these people at my Section.\"\\n  The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend \\ncitizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed,\\nevaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among\\nhis wood, and hid his confusion over  handle of his saw.\\n  Madame Defarge beckoned  Juryman and The Vengeance a little\\nnearer to  door, and there expounded her further views to them\\nthus:\\n  \"She will now be at home, awaiting  moment of his death. She will\\nbe mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach\\n justice of  Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its\\nenemies. I will go to her.\"\\n  \"What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!\" exclaimed Jacques\\nThree, rapturously. \"Ah, my cherished!\" cried The Vengeance; and\\nembraced her.\\n  \"Take you my knitting,\" said Madame Defarge, placing it in her\\nlieutenant\\'s hands, \"and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep\\nme my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably\\nbe a greater concourse than usual, to-day.\"\\n  \"I willingly obey  orders of my Chief,\" said The Vengeance with\\nalacrity, and kissing her cheek. \"You will not be late?\"\\n  \"I shall be there before  commencement.\"\\n  \"And before  tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,\"\\nsaid The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into\\n street, \"before  tumbrils arrive!\"\\n  Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and\\nmight be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through \\nmud, and round  corner of  prison wall. The Vengeance and \\nJuryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly\\nappreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.\\n  There were many women at that time, upon whom  time laid a\\ndreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to\\nbe dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along \\nstreets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and\\nreadiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not\\nonly seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to\\nstrike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities;\\n troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances.\\nBut, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and\\nan inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into\\na tigress. She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had \\nvirtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.\\n  It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for \\nsins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to\\nher, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an\\norphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her\\nnatural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To\\nappeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity,\\neven for herself. If she had been laid low in  streets, in any of\\n many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not\\nhave pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to  axe\\nto-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a\\nfierce desire to change places with  man who sent here there.\\n  Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly\\nworn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her\\ndark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her\\nbosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened\\ndagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with  confident tread of such a\\ncharacter, and with  supple freedom of a woman who had habitually\\nwalked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on  brown\\nsea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along  streets.\\n  Now, when  journey of  travelling coach, at that very moment\\nwaiting for  completion of its load, had been planned out last\\nnight,  difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged\\nMr. Lorry\\'s attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid\\noverloading  coach, but it was of  highest importance that \\ntime occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to\\n utmost; since their escape might depend on  saving of only a\\nfew seconds here and there. Finally, he had proposed, after anxious\\nconsideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave\\n city, should leave it at three o\\'clock in  lightest-wheeled\\nconveyance known to that period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would\\nsoon overtake  coach, and, passing it and preceding it on  road,\\nwould order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress\\nduring  precious hours of  night, when delay was  most to\\nbe dreaded.\\n  Seeing in this arrangement  hope of rendering real service in\\nthat pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and\\nJerry had beheld  coach start, had known who it was that Solomon\\nbrought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were\\nnow concluding their arrangements to follow  coach, even as\\nMadame Defarge, taking her way through  streets, now drew nearer\\nand nearer to  else-deserted lodging in which they held their\\nconsultation.\\n  \"Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,\" said Miss Pross, whose\\nagitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move,\\nor live: \"what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard?\\nAnother carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken\\nsuspicion.\"\\n  \"My opinion, miss,\" returned Mr. Cruncher, \"is as you\\'re right.\\nLikewise wot I\\'ll stand by you, right or wrong.\"\\n  \"I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious\\ncreatures,\" said Miss Pross, wildly crying, \"that I am incapable of\\nforming any plan. Are you capable of forming any plan, my dear good\\nMr. Cruncher?\"\\n  \"Respectin\\' a future spear o\\' life, miss,\" returned Mr. Cruncher, \"I\\nhope so. Respectin\\' any present use o\\' this here blessed old head o\\'\\nmind, I think not. Would you do me  favour, miss, to take notice o\\'\\ntwo promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here\\ncrisis?\"\\n  \"Oh, for gracious sake!\" cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying,\\n\"record them at once, and get them out of  way, like an excellent\\nman.\"\\n  \"First,\" said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who\\nspoke with an ashy and solemn visage, \"them poor things well out o\\'\\nthis, never no more will I do it, never no more!\"\\n  \"I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,\" returned Miss Pross, \"that you\\nnever will do it again, whatever it is, and I be, you not to think\\nit necessary to mention more particularly what it is.\"\\n  \"No, miss,\" returned Jerry, \"it shall not be named to you. Second:\\nthem poor things well out o\\' this, and never no more will I\\ninterfere with Mrs. Cruncher\\'s flopping, never no more!\"\\n  \"Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,\" said Miss Pross,\\nstriving to dry her eyes and compose herself, \"I have no doubt it is\\nbest that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own\\nsuperintendence.- O my poor darlings!\"\\n  \"I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,\" proceeded Mr. Cruncher,\\nwith a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit- \"and let\\nmy words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself- that\\nwot my opinions respectin\\' flopping has undergone a change, and that\\nwot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping\\nat  present time.\"\\n  \"There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,\" cried \\ndistracted Miss Pross, \"and I hope she finds it answering her\\nexpectations.\"\\n  \"Forbid it,\" proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,\\nadditional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold\\nout, \"as anything wot I have ever said or done should be visited on my\\nearnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn\\'t\\nall flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get \\'em out o\\' this here\\ndismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-BID it!\" This was Mr.\\nCruncher\\'s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find\\na better one.\\n  And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along  streets, came\\nnearer and nearer.\\n  \"If we ever get back to our native land,\" said Miss Pross, \"you\\nmay rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to\\nremember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and\\nat all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your\\nbeing thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us\\nthink! My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!\"\\n  Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along  streets, came\\nnearer and nearer.\\n  \"If you were to go before,\" said Miss Pross, \"and stop  vehicle\\nand horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me;\\nwouldn\\'t that be best?\"\\n  Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.\\n  \"Where could you wait for me?\" asked Miss Pross.\\n  Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality\\nbut Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and\\nMadame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.\\n  \"By  cathedral door,\" said Miss Pross. \"Would it be much out of\\n way, to take me in, near  great cathedral door between \\ntwo towers?\"\\n  \"No, miss,\" answered Mr. Cruncher.\\n  \"Then, like  best of men,\" said Miss Pross, \"go to \\nposting-house straight, and make that change.\"\\n  \"I am doubtful,\" said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,\\n\"about leaving of you, you see. We don\\'t know what may happen.\"\\n  \"Heaven knows we don\\'t,\" returned Miss Pross, \"but have no fear\\nfor me. Take me in at  cathedral, at Three o\\'Clock, or as near it\\nas you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from\\nhere. I feel certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think- not\\nof me, but of  lives that may depend on both of us!\"\\n  This exordium, and Miss Pross\\'s two hands in quite agonised entreaty\\nclasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he\\nimmediately went out to alter  arrangements, and left her by\\nherself to follow as she had proposed.\\n  The having originated a precaution which was already in course of\\nexecution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of\\ncomposing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice\\nin  streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it\\nwas twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get\\nready at once.\\n  Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of  loneliness of \\ndeserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every\\nopen door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began\\nlaving her eyes, which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish\\napprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a\\nminute at a time by  dripping water, but constantly paused and\\nlooked round to see that there was no one watching her. In one of\\nthose pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing\\nin  room.\\n  The basin fell to  ground broken, and  water flowed to \\nfeet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much\\nstaining blood, those feet had come to meet that water.\\n  Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, \"The wife of\\nEvremonde; where is she?\"\\n  It flashed upon Miss Pross\\'s mind that  doors were all standing\\nopen, and would suggest  flight. Her first act was to shut them.\\nThere were four in  room, and she shut them all. She then placed\\nherself before  door of  chamber which Lucie had occupied.\\n  Madame Defarge\\'s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,\\nand rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing\\nbeautiful about her; years had not tamed  wildness, or softened \\ngrimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in\\nher different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes,\\nevery inch.\\n  \"You might, from your appearance, be  wife of Lucifer,\" said Miss\\nPross, in her breathing. \"Nevertheless, you shall not get  better\\nof me. I am an Englishwoman.\"\\n  Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of\\nMiss Pross\\'s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a\\ntight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in \\nsame figure a woman with a strong hand, in  years gone by. She knew\\nfull well that Miss Pross was  family\\'s devoted friend; Miss\\nPross knew full well that Madame Defarge was  family\\'s malevolent\\nenemy.\\n  \"On my way yonder,\" said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of\\nher hand towards  fatal spot, \"where they reserve my chair and my\\nknitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I\\nwish to see her.\"\\n  \"I know that your intentions are evil,\" said Miss Pross, \"and you\\nmay depend upon it, I\\'ll hold my own against them.\"\\n  Each spoke in her own language; neither understood  other\\'s\\nwords; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and\\nmanner, what  unintelligible words meant.\\n  \"It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this\\nmoment,\" said Madame Defarge. \"Good patriots will know what that\\nmeans. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you\\nhear?\"\\n  \"If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,\" returned Miss Pross, \"and\\nI was an English four-poster, they shouldn\\'t loose a splinter of me.\\nNo, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.\"\\n  Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in\\ndetail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was\\nset at naught.\\n  \"Woman imbecile and pig-like!\" said Madame Defarge, frowning. \"I\\ntake no answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I\\ndemand to see her, or stand out of  way of  door and let me go\\nto her!\" This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.\\n  \"I little thought,\" said Miss Pross, \"that I should ever want to\\nunderstand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,\\nexcept  clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect  truth, or\\nany part of it.\"\\n  Neither of them for a single moment released  other\\'s eyes.\\nMadame Defarge had not moved from  spot where she stood when Miss\\nPross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.\\n  \"I am a Briton,\" said Miss Pross, \"I am desperate. I don\\'t care an\\nEnglish Twopence for myself. I know that  longer I keep you here,\\n greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I\\'ll not leave a handful of\\nthat dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!\"\\n  Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes\\nbetween every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.\\nThus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.\\n  But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought \\nirrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame\\nDefarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. \"Ha, ha!\"\\nshe laughed, \"you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to\\nthat Doctor.\" Then she raised her voice and called out, \"Citizen\\nDoctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this\\nmiserable fool, answer  Citizeness Defarge!\"\\n  Perhaps  following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in \\nexpression of Miss Pross\\'s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from\\neither suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.\\nThree of  doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.\\n  \"Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing,\\nthere are odds and ends upon  ground. There is no one in that\\nroom behind you! Let me look.\"\\n  \"Never!\" said Miss Pross, who understood  request as perfectly as\\nMadame Defarge understood  answer.\\n  \"If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and\\nbrought back,\" said Madame Defarge to herself.\\n  \"As long as you don\\'t know whether they are in that room or not, you\\nare uncertain what to do,\" said Miss Pross to herself; \"and you\\nshall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know\\nthat, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold\\nyou.\"\\n  \"I have been in  streets from  first, nothing has stopped\\nme, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\"\\nsaid Madame Defarge.\\n  \"We are alone at  top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we\\nare not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you\\nhere, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand\\nguineas to my darling,\" said Miss Pross.\\n  Madame Defarge made at  door. Miss Pross, on  instinct of\\n moment, seized her round  waist in both her arms, and held\\nher tight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to\\nstrike; Miss Pross, with  vigorous tenacity of love, always so much\\nstronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from \\nfloor in  struggle that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge\\nbuffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down,\\nheld her round  waist, and clung to her with more than  hold\\nof a drowning woman.\\n  Soon, Madame Defarge\\'s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her\\nencircled waist. \"It is under my arm,\" said Miss Pross, in smothered\\ntones, \"you shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless\\nHeaven for it. I hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!\"\\n  Madame Defarge\\'s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up,\\nsaw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and\\nstood alone- blinded with smoke.\\n  All this was in a second. As  smoke cleared, leaving an awful\\nstillness, it passed out on  air, like  soul of  furious\\nwoman whose body lay lifeless on  ground.\\n  In  first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed\\n body as far from it as she could, and ran down  stairs to\\ncall for fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of \\nconsequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It\\nwas dreadful to go in at  door again; but, she did go in, and\\neven went near it, to get  bonnet and other things that she must\\nwear. These she put on, out on  staircase, first shutting and\\nlocking  door and taking away  key. She then sat down on \\nstairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and\\nhurried away.\\n  By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly\\nhave gone along  streets without being stopped. By good fortune,\\ntoo, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show\\ndisfigurement like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for\\n marks of griping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was\\ntorn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was\\nclutched and dragged a hundred ways.\\n  In crossing  bridge, she dropped  door key in  river.\\nArriving at  cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and\\nwaiting there, she thought, what if  key were already taken in a\\nnet, what if it were identified, what if  door were opened and\\n remains discovered, what if she were stopped at  gate, sent\\nto prison, and charged with murder! In  midst of these fluttering\\nthoughts,  escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.\\n  \"Is there any noise in  streets?\" she asked him.\\n  \"The usual noises,\" Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by\\n question and by her aspect.\\n  \"I don\\'t hear you,\" said Miss Pross. \"What do you say?\"\\n  It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross\\ncould not hear him. \"So I\\'ll nod my head,\" thought Mr. Cruncher,\\namazed, \"at all events she\\'ll see that.\" And she did.\\n  \"Is there any noise in  streets now?\" asked Miss Pross again,\\npresently.\\n  Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.\\n  \"I don\\'t hear it.\"\\n  \"Gone deaf in an hour?\" said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind\\nmuch disturbed; \"wot\\'s come to her?\"\\n  \"I feel,\" said Miss Pross, \"as if there had been a flash and a\\ncrash, and that crash was  last thing I should ever hear in this\\nlife.\"\\n  \"Blest if she ain\\'t in a queer condition!\" said Mr. Cruncher, more\\nand more disturbed. \"Wot can she have been a takin\\', to keep her\\ncourage up? Hark! There\\'s  roll of them dreadful carts! You can\\nhear that, miss?\"\\n  \"I can hear,\" said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her,\\n\"nothing. O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a\\ngreat stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and\\nunchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.\"\\n  \"If she don\\'t hear  roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh\\ntheir journey\\'s end,\" said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder,\\n\"it\\'s my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this\\nworld.\"\\n  And indeed she never did.\\n  XV\\n  THE FOOTSTEPS DIE OUT FOR EVER\\n\\n  ALONG THE PARIS STREETS,  death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh.\\nSix tumbrils carry  day\\'s wine to La Guillotine. All \\ndevouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could\\nrecord itself, are fused in  one realisation, Guillotine. And yet\\nthere is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a\\nblade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to\\nmaturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced\\nthis horror. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar\\nhammers, and it will twist itself into  same tortured forms. Sow\\n same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it\\nwill surely yield  same fruit according to its kind.\\n  Six tumbrils roll along  streets. Change these back again to what\\nthey were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be\\n carriages of absolute monarchs,  equipages of feudal nobles,\\n toilettes of flaring Jezebels,  churches that are not my\\nfather\\'s house but dens of thieves,  huts of millions of starving\\npeasants! No;  great magician who majestically works out \\nappointed order of  Creator, never reverses his transformations.\\n\"If thou be changed into this shape by  will of God,\" say  seers\\nto  enchanted, in  wise Arabian stories, \"then remain so! But,\\nif thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume\\nthy former aspect!\" Changeless and hopeless,  tumbrils roll along.\\n  As  sombre wheels of  six carts go round, they seem to\\nplough up a long crooked furrow among  populace in  streets.\\nRidges of faces are thrown to this side and to that, and  ploughs\\ngo steadily onward. So used are  regular inhabitants of \\nhouses to  spectacle, that in many windows there are no people, and\\nin some  occupation of  hands is not so much as suspended,\\nwhile,  eyes survey  faces in  tumbrils. Here and there,\\n inmate has visitors to see  sight; then he points his finger,\\nwith something of  complacency of a curator or authorised exponent,\\nto this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday,\\nand who there  day before.\\n  Of  riders in  tumbrils, some observe these things, and all\\nthings on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a\\nlingering interest in  ways of life and men. Some, seated with\\ndrooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so\\nheedful of their looks that they cast upon  multitude such\\nglances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several\\nclose their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts\\ntogether. Only one, and he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect,\\nis so shattered and made drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries\\nto dance. Not one of  whole number appeals by look or gesture, to\\n pity of  people.\\n  There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of  tumbrils,\\nand faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some\\nquestion. It would seem to be always  same question, for, it is\\nalways followed by a press of people towards  third cart. The\\nhorsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with\\ntheir swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands\\nat  back of  tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with\\na mere girl who sits on  side of  cart, and holds his hand. He\\nhas no curiosity or care for  scene about him, and always speaks to\\nto  girl. Here and there in  long street of St. Honore, cries\\nare raised against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a\\nquiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his\\nface. He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound.\\n  On  steps of a church, awaiting  coming-up of  tumbrils,\\nstands  Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into  first of them:\\nnot there. He looks into  second: not there. He already asks\\nhimself, \"Has he sacrificed me?\" when his face clears, as he looks\\ninto  third.\\n  \"Which is Evremonde?\" says a man behind him.\\n  \"That. At  back there.\"\\n  \"With his hand in  girl\\'s?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  The man cries, \"Down, Evremonde To  Guillotine all aristocrats!\\nDown, Evremonde!\"\\n  \"Hush, hush!\"  Spy entreats him, timidly.\\n  \"And why not, citizen?\"\\n  \"He is going to pay  forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes\\nmore. Let him be at peace.\"\\n  But  man continuing to exclaim, \"Down, Evremonde!\"  face of\\nEvremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees\\n Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.\\n  The clocks are on  stroke of three, and  furrow ploughed among\\n populace is turning round, to come on into  place of execution,\\nand end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in\\nand close behind  last plough as it passes on, for all are\\nfollowing to  Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a\\ngarden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On\\none of  foremost chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for\\nher friend.\\n  \"Therese!\" she cries, in her shrill tones. \"Who has seen her?\\nTherese Defarge!\"\\n  \"She never missed before,\" says a knitting-woman of  sisterhood.\\n  \"No; nor will she miss now,\" cries The Vengeance, petulantly.\\n  \"Therese.\"\\n  \"Louder,\"  woman recommends.\\n  Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear\\nthee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet\\nit will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,\\nlingering somewhere; and yet, although  messengers have done\\ndread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will\\ngo far enough to find her!\\n  \"Bad Fortune!\" cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in \\nchair, \"and here are  tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in\\na wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty\\nchair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!\"\\n  As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, \\ntumbrils begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte\\nGuillotine are robed and ready. Crash!- A head is held up, and \\nknitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment\\nago when it could think and speak, count One.\\n  The second tumbril empties and moves on;  third comes up. Crash!-\\nAnd  knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their work,\\ncount Two.\\n  The supposed Evremonde descends, and  seamstress is lifted out\\nnext after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting\\nout, but still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with\\nher back to  crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls,\\nand she looks into his face and thanks him.\\n  \"But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am\\nnaturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have\\nbeen able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we\\nmight have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me\\nby Heaven.\"\\n  \"Or you to me,\" says Sydney Carton. \"Keep your eyes upon me, dear\\nchild, and mind no other object.\"\\n  \"I mind nothing while I hold your band. I shall mind nothing when\\nI let it go, if they are rapid.\"\\n  \"They will be rapid. Fear not!\"\\n  The two stand in  fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak\\nas if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart\\nto heart, these two children of  Universal Mother, else so wide\\napart and differing, have come together on  dark highway, to repair\\nhome together, and to rest in her bosom.\\n  \"Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last\\nquestion? I am very ignorant, and it troubles me- just a little.\"\\n  \"Tell me what it is.\"\\n  \"I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself,\\nwhom I love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she\\nlives in a farmer\\'s house in  south country. Poverty parted us, and\\nshe knows nothing of my fate- for I cannot write- and if I could,\\nhow should I tell her! It is better as it is.\"\\n  \"Yes, yes: better as it is.\"\\n  \"What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still\\nthinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so\\nmuch support, is this:- If  Republic really does good to \\npoor, and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less,\\nshe may live a long time: she may even live to be old.\"\\n  \"What then, my gentle sister?\"\\n  \"Do you think:\"  uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much\\nendurance, fill with tears, and  lips part a little more and\\ntremble: \"that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in \\nbetter land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully\\nsheltered?\"\\n  \"It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble\\nthere.\"\\n  \"You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now?\\nIs  moment come?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.\\nThe spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse\\nthan a sweet, bright constancy is in  patient face. She goes next\\nbefore him- is gone;  knitting-women count Twenty-Two.\\n  \"I am  Resurrection and  Life, saith  Lord: he that\\nbelieveth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever\\nliveth and believeth in me shall never die.\"\\n  The murmuring of many voices,  upturning of many faces, \\npressing on of many footsteps in  outskirts of  crowd, so that\\nit swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all\\nflashes away. Twenty-Three.\\n\\n  They said of him, about  city that night, that it was \\npeacefullest man\\'s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked\\nsublime and prophetic.\\n  One of  most remarkable sufferers by  same axe- a woman- had\\nasked at  foot of  same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed\\nto write down  thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given\\nany utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been\\nthese:\\n  \"I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance,  Juryman, \\nJudge, long ranks of  new oppressors who have risen on \\ndestruction of  old, perishing by this retributive instrument,\\nbefore it shall cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city\\nand a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles\\nto be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long long\\nto come, I see  evil of this time and of  previous time of which\\nthis is  natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and\\nwearing out.\\n  \"I see  lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,\\nprosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see\\nHer with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her\\nfather, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men\\nin his healing office, and at peace. I see  good old man, so long\\ntheir friend, in ten years\\' time enriching them with all he has, and\\npassing tranquilly to his reward.\\n  \"I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in  hearts of\\ntheir descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping\\nfor me on  anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband,\\ntheir course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I\\nknow that each was not more honoured and held sacred in  other\\'s\\nsoul, than I was in  souls of both.\\n  \"I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man\\nwinning his way up in that path of life which once was mine.
